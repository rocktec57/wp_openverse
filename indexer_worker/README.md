# Indexer Worker

An indexer worker serves a small Falcon API which can be used to perform a chunk
of a "reindexing task", whereby records from a downstream table are converted
into ES documents and uploaded to an Elasticsearch index in bulk. The data
refresh DAG orchestrates multiple indexer workers, each of which performs a
portion of the total reindexing.
