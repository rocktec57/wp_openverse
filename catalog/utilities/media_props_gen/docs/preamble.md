# Catalog Media Properties

_This document is auto-generated from the source code in
[/catalog/utilities/media_props_gen/generate_media_properties.py](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/blob/main/catalog/utilities/media_props_gen/generate_media_properties.py)._

This is a list of the media properties, with the descriptions of corresponding
database columns and Python objects that are used to store and retrieve media
data. The order of the properties corresponds to their order in the `image`
table. Property names typically match those of the database columns, except when
noted otherwise in the Python column's name property.
