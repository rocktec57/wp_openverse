# Ingestion server changelogs

Changelogs for the internal ingestion server service.

<!--

Because there are no ingestion server changelogs yet, we need to comment
this toctree directive out or the build fails due to warnings of unmatched
files. Luckily, the first time a changelog is added, the build will fail
due to the new changelog file not being included in the toc tree. At that
point, whoever is revieweing the changelog PR should uncomment this
toctree and remove this block of text.

```{toctree}
:glob:
:reversed:
:titlesonly:
