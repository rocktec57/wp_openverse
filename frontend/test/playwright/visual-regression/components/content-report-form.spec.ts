/**
 * This test was previously known to be flaky:
 * https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/2020
 *
 * The flake involved an offset of 1-2 pixels in both
 * the content and width of the popover (the locator
 * produced with `getReportButton`). To fix this, the
 * test now uses a screenshot of the entire page, rather
 * than the isolated report element, and an increased
 * maxDiffPixel ratio.
 *
 * Additionally, previously there were focused/unfocused
 * tests to confirm the proper focus state of the
 * report popover close button. However, that state
 * only appears on focus visible and the snapshots
 * were identical, so the tests were redundant.
