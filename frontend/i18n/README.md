# Locales

The primary internationalisation file is [`data/en.json5`](../data/en.json5).
All `.json` files present in the [`locales`](./locales) directory are
re-generated when updating translations, so they should not be modified.

# Locale scripts

Locale scripts should be run in the root of the repository using their
respective pnpm commands, in the `i18n` namespace.
