# DO NOT actually run `pnpm install` here. Doing so requires us to copy the the source into the container.
# However, that's a waste of time because we mount the source in the compose file anyway.
# Instead, we run `pnpm install` in the entrypoint script defined in the compose file.
# ENTRYPOINT ["pnpm", "install", "&&"]
