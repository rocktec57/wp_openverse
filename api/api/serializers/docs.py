Get the collection of media with a specific tag. Returns the collection of media
that has the specified tag, matching exactly and entirely.

Differences that will cause tags to not match are:
- upper and lower case letters
- diacritical marks
- hyphenation
- spacing
- multi-word tags where the query is only one of the words in the tag
- multi-word tags where the words are in a different order.

Examples of tags that **do not** match:
- "Low-Quality" and "low-quality"
- "jalape√±o" and "jalapeno"
- "Saint Pierre des Champs" and "Saint-Pierre-des-Champs"
- "dog walking" and "dog  walking" (where the latter has two spaces between the
last two words, as in a typographical error)
- "runner" and "marathon runner"
- "exclaiming loudly" and "loudly exclaiming"

For non-exact or multi-tag matching, using the `tags` query parameter.
