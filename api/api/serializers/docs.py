**Creator collection**
When used with `{COLLECTION}=creator&source=sourceName`, returns the collection of media
by the specified creator. Notice that a single creator's media items
can be found on several sources, but this collection only returns the
items from the specified source.
This is why for this collection, both the creator and the source
parameters are required, and matched exactly. For a fuzzy creator search,
use the default search without the `{COLLECTION}` parameter.

Get the collection of media with a specific tag. Returns the collection of media
that has the specified tag, matching exactly and entirely.

Differences that will cause tags to not match are:
- upper and lower case letters
- diacritical marks
- hyphenation
- spacing
- multi-word tags where the query is only one of the words in the tag
- multi-word tags where the words are in a different order.

Examples of tags that **do not** match:
- "Low-Quality" and "low-quality"
- "jalape√±o" and "jalapeno"
- "Saint Pierre des Champs" and "Saint-Pierre-des-Champs"
- "dog walking" and "dog  walking" (where the latter has two spaces between the
last two words, as in a typographical error)
- "runner" and "marathon runner"
- "exclaiming loudly" and "loudly exclaiming"

For non-exact or multi-tag matching, using the `tags` query parameter.
