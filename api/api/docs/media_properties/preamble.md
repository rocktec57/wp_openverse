# API Media Properties

_This document is auto-generated from the source code in
[/api/api/management/commands/documentmedia.py](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/blob/main/api/api/management/commands/documentmedia.py)._

This is a list of the media properties, with the descriptions of corresponding
database columns and Python objects that are used to store and retrieve media
data.

## General notes

The columns are sorted alphabetically and separated into relations (used to
establish relationships to other models) and values (used to hold some data
value). Note that relation fields are always nullable.
