The contents of this directory is autogenerated and shouldn't be modified
manually. It stores the latest migration of each of the installed applications.
When two git branches are merged, and they contain different sets of migrations,
a merge migration has to be applied on top of them. This is enforced by putting
the name of the latest migration to the file in this directory, and if two
branches have different migrations, there will be a conflict in this file which
will stop git from doing an unsafe merge.
