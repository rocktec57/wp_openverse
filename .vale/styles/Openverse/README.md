# Openverse vale style

The Openverse vale style is manually curated by Openverse maintainers. These
rules are primarily meant to cater to exceptions in the Openverse documentation
style that do not fit into pre-existing style guides, whether because of
disagreements in style or different institutional or contextual requirements
based on Openverse's domain and nature as a FOSS project within the WordPress
community.
