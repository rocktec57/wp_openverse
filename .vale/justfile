# The --glob setting excludes things that should not be linted, including
# build artefacts, dependencies, and automatically generated files like
# the changelogs (without excluding `changelogs/index.md`). Project proposals
# are also excluded for want of a good way to ignore existing proposals and only
# lint _new_ proposals. Project proposals aren't "living documents" in the way
# the rest of our documentation is, so it doesn't seem right to retroactively
# edit them for mere editorial purposes (rather than, for example, to correct
# some grave inacurracy).
# Leading `,` compensates for lack of trailing comma support
# Note the lack of space before the trailing \ on each line, this is to prevent
# the addition of a space between each pattern, which isn't supported by Vale's glob
# If you change this and Vale takes a very long time to run (more than 30 seconds)
# then chances are the change is breaking the glob pattern. Unfortunately the only
# feedback you get when the glob pattern is not working as intended is a very long
# run time for Vale as it checks everything that should have otherwise been ignored,
# but wasn't due to some minor issue in the pattern syntax.
# This is fiddly, but I can't find a good way around it.
