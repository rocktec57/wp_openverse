"""
Parses docker-compose file and generates an integration-test-docker-compose.yml.
The generated file is written to the same directory this script resides in.

Q: Why didn't you just use multiple docker-compose files and inheritance?

A: If you are running the development docker-compose file already, launching 
   an inherited elasticsearch/postgres service will result in the containers
   being destroyed and recreated. Using this approach ensures that:
        1) Running tests doesn't interfere with your development environment.   
        2) The file stays up-to-date without manual copy-pasting.
        3) We don't blow up running containers on Travis CI.
