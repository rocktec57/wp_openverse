"""
Parses the top-level Docker Compose file and generates one for the integration tests.

The generated file is written to the same directory this script resides in with
the name ``integration-docker-compose.yml``.

A new file is generated instead of inheritance because using an inherited file
will result in the containers being destroyed and recreated. By using generated
files we ensure an up-to-date copy that does not interfere with the development
environment.
