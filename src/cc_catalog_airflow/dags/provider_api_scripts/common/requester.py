    Provides a method `get` that is a wrapper around `get` from the
    `requests` module (i.e., it simply passes along whatever arguments it
    receives).  The difference is that when this class is initialized
    with a non-zero `delay` parameter, it waits for at least that number
    of seconds between consecutive requests. This is to avoid hitting
    rate limits of APIs.

    Optional Arguments:
    delay:  an integer giving the minimum number of seconds to wait
            between consecutive requests via the `get` method.
