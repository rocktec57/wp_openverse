To counter this, the German government invited aircraft manufacturers to submit prototype single-seat fighter designs for evaluation at a competition to be held at Adlershof airfield in Berlin in January 1918. The aircraft would be demonstrated by the manufacturers, and would be tested by front-line combat pilots. The design with the best overall performance would be awarded a production contract. Thirty-one airplanes from ten manufacturers were evaluated for such qualities as speed, maneuverability, diving ability, pilot's view, climbing rate, performance at high altitude, etc. One rotary-engined and one in-line-engined design were selected."

Because the hoped-for higher horsepower rotary engines intended for use in the Fokker D.VI were not available soon enough, the airplane had to be fitted with an older, lower-horsepower engine, which rendered performance below combat standards. The Fokker D.VI saw little operational service and was relegated to home defense and training roles."

The V.11 was largely the creation of Fokker's chief designer, Reinhold Platz. Platz was the true creative force behind the famous Fokker fighters of the second half of the war. He did most of the fundamental design work on the firm's aircraft after 1916. Anthony Fokker's talents were greater as a test pilot than as a designer. He had an innate ability to fly an experimental aircraft and know just what improvements needed to be made to turn it into a successful performer. This intuitive sense on the part of Fokker, combined with Platz's innovative preliminary designs, made them a formidable team. Fokker's ego and dominating personality frequently led him to understate Platz's role as the genuine innovator of the designs that bore the Fokker name, and he took undue credit for himself. Nevertheless, there is no denying the important contributions Fokker made to bringing Platz's designs to final form. This was especially true in the case of the Fokker D.VII."

On January 23, famed German ace, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, flew the V.11 at Fokker's request. Richthofen thought the airplane was maneuverable and had generally good performance, but that it was tricky to handle and directionally unstable, especially in a dive. Ritchhofen's assessment confirmed Fokker's own impression of the V.11 from his brief testing of the airplane before the competition began. To remedy these problems, Fokker lengthened the fuselage 40 cm (16 in), added a fixed vertical fin and a new rudder shape, and altered the aileron balances, among other small changes. With these modifications, the V.11 was safe and pleasant to fly, and had lost little of the maneuverability that had initially impressed von Richthofen. The Red Baron flew the improved V.11 and now found the airplane delightful to handle. He urged other pilots at the competition to try it, and they also thought the design was very promising. Given his stature, the endorsement of von Richthofen went far towards the selection of the V.11 as the winner of the competition."

His instinctive sense of precisely how to quickly modify the V.11 to transform it from a merely acceptable airplane into a winning design illustrated his genius for incorporating flight test results into design. Moreover, Fokker understood better than any of his competitors that overall performance was more important in a fighter aircraft than exceptional performance in one or two areas, such as speed or climb rate. Other aircraft at Adlershof were better than the V.11 in individual performance parameters. But none surpassed it as a fighter design in the complete sense, regarding not only overall performance but also structural and production concerns."

Concerned that the Fokker factory would be unable to meet the demand for the new fighter, IdFlieg (Inspektion der fliegertruppen), directed Albatros, (Fokker's great rival) to produce D.VIIs under license. Albatros built the Fokker D.VII at both its Johannisthal and Schneidem\u00fchl factories, known as Albatros-Werke G.m.b.H. and Osdeutsche Albatros Werke respectively. The Johannisthal-built aircraft carried the designation Fokker D.VII (Alb) and those constructed at Schneidem\u00fchl were identified Fokker D.VII (O.A.W.). Because the Fokker factory produced no construction drawings, working only from jigs and assembly sketches, Albatros had to make its own drawings, based on a completed airframe obtained from Fokker. This, in addition to each firm applying its own construction techniques and standards, resulted in Fokker D.VIIs that looked alike, but differed in detail. Thus, not all components were interchangeable on airplanes built at the three factories. Moreover, the aircraft built by Albatros were generally considered to be of higher quality than those produced by the primary contractor, Fokker. Interestingly, more Fokker D.VIIs were produced by Albatros than by Fokker, with a total for all three factories of approximately 1,000 aircraft."

By the summer, however, the Mercedes-powered D.VII was already having difficulty keeping pace with the latest Allied fighters. The airplane was then experimentally fitted with the new 185-horsepower B.M.W. IIIa, which dramatically improved performance. Unfortunately, only limited quantities of the B.M.W. IIIa were available. The B.M.W.-powered model, known as the D.VIIF, was much sought after by the German pilots, but could only be supplied in small numbers."

One reason for this was the soon-to-be-famous ability of the Fokker D.VII to seemingly \"hang on its propeller,\" and fire into the unprotected underside of Allied two-seater reconnaissance aircraft. The Fokker D.VII's thick wing section endowed the airplane with good stall characteristics. Positioning below and behind a two-seater, where the enemy observer could not bring his guns to bear, a D.VII pilot could safely put his airplane into a nose-high attitude, with full power, in a nearly stalled condition. The capability of the D.VII to perform this maneuver made it a highly feared opponent in combat."

On November 9, 1918, two days before the end of the war, Lieutenant Heinz Freiherr von Beaulieu-Marconnay landed the NASM Fokker D.VII at a forward American airfield being used by the 95th Aero Squadron, near Verdun. The pilot and airplane were captured by three American officers before Beaulieu-Marconnay could set fire to his aircraft. It is uncertain whether or not Beaulieu-Marconnay was lost and mistakenly landed at what he thought was a German airfield (as he claimed), or simply surrendered, knowing that the war would soon be over and fabricated the story. The Fokker D.VII was brought to the United States after the war and given to the Smithsonian Institution by the War Department in 1920. The airplane was fully restored by NASM in 1961. Further minor work was done on the D.VII in 1991 to prepare it for the museum's new World War I exhibition, Legend, Memory, and the Great War in the Air."

Winning designs had to meet a number specified performance standards. Flight trials with the Wrights' entry began at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 3, 1908. After several days of successful flights, tragedy occurred on September 17, when Orville Wright crashed with Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge, the Army's observer, as his passenger. Orville survived with severe injuries, but Selfridge was killed, becoming the first fatality in a powered airplane."

The general requirements were as follows: that it be designed to be easily assembled and disassembled so that an army wagon could transport it; that it would be able to carry two people with a combined weight of 160 kg (350 lb), and sufficient fuel for 200 km (125 mi); that it would be able to reach a speed of at least 64 kph (40 mph) in still air. This speed performance would be calculated during a two-lap test flight over a five-mile course, with and against the wind. It must demonstrate the ability to remain in the air for at least one hour without landing, and then land without causing any damage that would prevent it from immediately starting another flight. It should be able to ascend in any sort of country in which the Signal Corps might need it in field service and be able to land without requiring a specially prepared spot; be able to land safely in case of accident to the propelling machinery; and be simple enough to permit someone to become proficient in its operation within a reasonable amount of time."

This airplane made its first flight at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 3, 1908. Several days of very successful and increasingly ambitious flights followed. Orville set new duration records day after day, including a 70-minute flight on September 11. He also made two flights with a passenger."

The airplane had circled the field four and a half times when a propeller blade split. The aircraft, then at 46 m (150 ft), safely glided to 23 m (75 ft), when it then plunged to earth. Orville was severely injured, including a broken hip, but Lieutenant Selfridge was killed and the aircraft was destroyed. Selfridge was the first person to die in a powered airplane accident."

                "content": "On June 3, 1909, the Wrights returned to Fort Myer with a new machine to complete the trials begun in 1908. (Wilbur had been flying in Europe the previous year and had thus been absent from Fort Myer in 1908.) The engine was the same as in the earlier aircraft, but the 1909 model had a smaller wing area and modifications to the rudder and the wire bracing. Lt. Frank P. Lahm and Lt. Benjamin D. Foulois, future Army pilots, were the Wrights' passengers. On July 27, with Lahm, Orville made a record flight of 1 hour, 12 minutes, and 40 seconds, covering approximately 64 km (40 mi). This satisfied the Army's endurance and passenger carrying requirements. To establish the speed of the airplane, a course was set up from Fort Myer to Shooter's Hill in Alexandria, Virginia, a distance of 8 km (5 mi). After waiting several days for optimum wind conditions, Orville and Foulois made the ten-mile round trip on July 30. The out lap speed was 37.7 mph and the return lap was 47.4 mph, giving an average speed of 42.5 mph. For the 2 mph over the required 40, the Wrights earned an additional $5,000, making the final sale price of the airplane $30,000."

In addition, the War Department proposed shipment of the original 1909 Army airplane to the Wright Company factory in Dayton, Ohio, to have it rebuilt with Model B controls and other improvements. The Wright Company quoted a price of $2,000 for the upgrade, but advised against it because of the many design improvements that had been made during the intervening two years. The manager of the Wright Company, Frank Russell, learned that the Smithsonian Institution was interested in the first Army airplane and would welcome its donation to the national museum. The War Department agreed and approved the transfer on May 4, 1911. The aircraft was restored close to its original 1909 configuration, but a few non-original braces added for the wheeled landing gear in 1910 remained on the airplane when it was turned over to the Smithsonian. Apart from a few minor repairs over the years, the airplane has not been restored since its acquisition in 1911. Of the three Wright airplanes in the NASM collection, the 1909 Military Flyer retains the largest percentage of its original material and components."

The P-40 was the only American land-based fighter available at the time but it was also seriously deficient in speed, range, and altitude performance. North American declined to build it but proposed a completely original design and promised to finish it in less than three months. North American completed the NA-73 airframe 117 days later and installed an in-line, liquid-cooled Allison engine. This aircraft first flew on October 25, 1940. During flight tests, the airplane exhibited outstanding performance, particularly in level-flight speed. The British enthusiastically ordered 150 examples of the airplane and the Royal Air Force (RAF) named it the Mustang. The U. S. Army Air Corps also showed interest and in 1941 they ordered 500 ground-attack variants designated the A-36."

                "content": "Early in 1942, the British tested four RAF Mustangs fitted with the two-stage, two-speed Merlin 65 engine. The supercharger in the Merlin 65 was optimized to produce sea-level horsepower up to approximately 9,150 m (30,000 ft). Urged on by Rolls Royce and British and American fighter pilots who sampled the new Mustang, North American obtained two Merlin 61 engines similar to the 65 and installed them in airframes designated XP-51Bs. The new variant had good range and outstanding speed, about 80 kph (50 mph) faster than previous models. Thus was born the world's best long-range, propeller-driven escort fighter. With improved range and speed, P-51 squadrons could now accompany 8th Air Force bombers on long-range raids over Europe. Bomber losses dropped sharply when fighters could protect them during their entire mission. The Mustang also proved itself in the Pacific theater. Again, the P-51 had the range, speed, and endurance to escort Boeing B-29 Superfortresses conducting long-range bombing attacks. The newly independent U. S. Air Force used the airplane during the Korean War for close-support, ground attack missions but it was not suited for this dangerous mission. One of the Mustang's few vulnerable spots was the cooling system. A single bullet through a radiator or pipe was usually enough to down a P-51."

The Air Force did not withdraw P-51s from service until 1957."

The Army Air Forces first assigned the fighter to Andrews Field, outside Washington, D.C., and later to Freeman Field, Indiana. After eleven months and 211 flying hours of operational service, this Mustang was set aside as a museum specimen and later transferred to the National Air Museum. When NASM acquired this Mustang, it bore a proud admonition on both sides of the fuselage in large black letters: \"Guard The Victory, Join the AAF.\" The airplane was probably used for recruiting drives toward the end of its military career. For exhibit purposes, this Mustang is painted in the colors and markings of the 351st Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force. This unit converted from North American P-47 Thunderbolts to Mustangs on September 30, 1944, while stationed at Raydon, Suffolk, England. The 353rd is typical of the many units assigned to escort bombers on missions deep into Germany. After air engagements to protect the bombers, the P-51s of the 353rd would attack enemy aircraft and ground installations on strafing missions on their way home. This fighter group claimed 330 1/2 aircraft shot down and 414 destroyed on the ground. It was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for the support of airborne landings in Holland."

With these models and a camera, Archer fabricated aerial combat photographs. People thought they were authentic and boasted them as the best aerial combat pictures ever taken. G.P. Putnam's Sons publishing house in New York featured his photographs in an exhibition of aviation art titled, \"The World in the Air.\" The popularity of the photographs increased when the book, Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot, written by Archer himself, was published in 1933. In it he created personas and a story about a RFC pilot who took a camera from a downed German aircraft and rigged it under his wing in order to take the pictures. His wife Betty participated in the hoax by posing as Gladys Maud Cockburn-Lange and sold the photographs, known as the Cockburn-Lange collection, to numerous individuals and publishing companies. The truth about the Archer's hoax was discovered in the 1980's by Peter Grosz and NASM curatorial assistant Karl Schneide when the museum received the collection from Archer's friend, John Charlton."

Archer used this camera for photography during his RAF service during World War I. Archer was born in the United States, but traveled to Great Britain to join the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. He served during World War I until his S.E.5 aircraft was shot down by German ground fire on October 9, 1918. A bullet almost reached his heart, but was stopped by his .45 caliber pistol which is now in NASM's collection (Ref: A19830217000). Archer is perhaps more famous for pulling off one of the biggest photographic hoaxes ever produced."

Langley's simple approach was merely to scale up the unpiloted Aerodromes of 1896 to human-carrying proportions. The construction details and distribution of stresses on the Aerodrome A, as the full-sized version was called, were based on the successful performance of a gasoline-powered model, one-fourth the size. This exact scale miniature, known as the Quarter-scale Aerodrome, made two flights of 46 m (150 ft) and 108 m (350 ft) on June 18, 1901, powered by a five-cylinder radial internal combustion gasoline engine of about 3.2 horsepower. Between 1901 and 1903, the engine was rebuilt to produce slightly more than three horsepower, after which a final flight of 308 m (1,000 ft) was made on August 8, 1903. Because the structural and control requirements for a full-sized, piloted airplane were very different, the satisfactory flights of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome masked its flaws as a design prototype for the Aerodrome A. When twice attempted to fly in 1903, the Aerodrome A met with disastrous results, ending Langley's aeronautical experiments entirely."

He became the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1887. Langley had begun serious investigation into heavier-than-air flight several years earlier while at the then Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh (now the University of Pittsburgh). He had erected a huge, 18.3 m (60 ft) diameter whirling arm at the university's Allegheny Observatory to perform aerodynamic research. At full speed, the tips of the whirling arm approached seventy miles per hour. Langley mostly ran tests with flat plates, but he also mounted small model airplanes he called aerostats, and even stuffed birds, on the arm. He also conducted an extensive series of experiments with rubber band-powered models."

He then moved away from purely theoretical aerodynamic research, and began work aimed at engineering an actual flying machine. In 1891, he started to experiment with large, tandem-winged models, approximately 4 m (13 ft) in wingspan, powered by small steam and gasoline engines. Another large whirling arm, 9 m (29.5 ft) in diameter, was set up at the Smithsonian to test curved wing shapes and propellers, probably in connection with the design of these large powered models that Langley called aerodromes."

                "content": "After several failures with designs that were too fragile and under-powered to sustain themselves, Langley had his first genuine success. On May 6, 1896, Langley's Aerodrome No. 5 made the first successful flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven, heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of 1,005 m (3,300 ft) and a second of 700 m (2,300 ft), at a speed of approximately 25 miles per hour. On November 28, another successful flight was made with a similar model, the Aerodrome No.6. It flew a distance of approximately 1,460 m (4,790 ft)."

He believed his only real hope of securing the kind of funding necessary was from the federal government. The breakthrough came when Langley's friend and colleague, Charles D. Walcott, of the U.S. Geological Survey, offered to present the proposal to President McKinley. A panel was created to review Langley's work up to that time. The panel, which included Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, met at the Smithsonian in April 1898. After a week of deliberations, they approved a grant of $50,000 from the Board of Ordnance and Fortification for Langley to construct a full-sized aircraft. The outbreak of the Spanish-American War only five days earlier contributed to the panel's favorable and speedy decision."

The upper wing was flush with the top of the fuselage, permitting the pilot to see over the wing. All ribs were of spruce conforming to the Curtiss C-80 airfoil section, and the ailerons, made of metal, were fabric-covered. The cantilever vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer were of wood."

Gilman sketched a design for a 559 kW (750-hp), 12-cylinder engine that would incorporate high-temperature glycol cooling and a turbosupercharger. The U.S. Navy contracted with Allison to supply the engine (known as the V-1710-A) for use on its airships. Originally known for modified Liberty engines and developing propeller reduction gears, this was the first of Allison\u2019s own engines. Two years later the Army ordered a modified, more powerful version; redesigned during development and reintroduced in 1936 as the V-1710-C6."

The Army Air Corps bought it in 1936 and flew it for 300 hours in the Consolidated XA-11A attack aircraft."

This sweptwing research plane attained Mach 2.005 (1,291 mph) while in a shallow dive at an altitude of 62,000 feet. Seconds afterward, the plane's XLR-8 rocket engine exhausted its fuel supply and shut down.

The Navy issued a letter of intent to Douglas on June 22, 1945, for construction of six Model D-558 aircraft, having straight, thin wing and tail surfaces, and turbojet propulsion. Development of the aircraft began under the direction of chief engineer Edward H. Heinemann. Subsequent analysis of captured data on wartime German sweptwing research, combined with sweptwing studies by American scientist Robert T. Jones, caused Douglas and the Navy to modify the D-558 contract by deleting three of the planned aircraft and replacing them with three sweptwing vehicles powered by both tu4bojet and rocket engines. The first three aircraft, each powered by a single General Electric TG-180 turbojet, became known as the D-558-1 Skystreak series. The last three, powered initially by a Westinghouse J-34 turbojet for low-speed flight plus a Reaction Motors, XLR-8 rocket engine for high-speed research, became known as the D558-2 Skyrocket series."

Because of its engine type and airframe design, the D-558-1 was limited to approximately Mach 1, the speed of sound. The more powerful D558-2, using its 6,000-pound-thrust rocket engine fueled with liquid oxygen and diluted ethyl alcohol, could easily exceed Mach 1. The safety hazards of operating a heavily loaded rocket-propelled airplane from the ground later caused Douglas to modify the D-558-2 #2 and #3 for air launching from the bomb bay of a converted Boeing P2B-1S (Navy B-29) Superfortress. At the same time, Douglas modified the D-558-2 #2 to all-rocket propulsion, utilizing the space formerly taken up by its turbojet engine for additional rocket fuel. Thus modified, the D-558-2 #2 was capable of reaching Mach 2, which it did while being flown in a special high-speed flight"

CaIdwell set a new world air-speed record of 640.663 mph while flying the D-558-1 #1. Five days later, on August 20,. 1947, Marine Corps Maj. Marion Carl, while flying the second D-558-1, bureau number 37971 (NACA 141), broke CaIdwells record by reaching 650.796 mph. The NACA utilized the third D-558-1, bureau number 37972 (NACA 142), for extensive investigations of transonic aerodynamic phenomena and aircraft behavior, retiring this Skystreak in 1953. The D-558-1 #1 did exceed Mach 1 on September 29, 1948, while piloted by Eugene F. May and flown in a 35-degree dive. One Skystreak, the D-558-1 #2, crashed on May 3, 1948 during a takeoff accident following engine failure, killing Howard C. Lilly, a NACA research pilot."

The second Skyrocket, bureau number 37974 (NACA 144), went to the NACA, which used it to investigate the behavior characteristics of sweptwings. During this program, before its conversion to all-rocket propulsion, the D-558-2 #2 revealed the tendency of sweptwing aircraft to pitch up under certain aerodynamic conditions. After modification in 1950 to all-rocket configuration, the D-558-2 #2 attained Mach 1 .88 and an unofficial altitude record of 79,494 feet. while flown by Douglas test pilot William B. Bridgeman. Following delivery to the NACA, this Skyrocket extended its unofficial record altitude to 83,235 feet, while flown by Marine test pilot Marion Carl on August 21, 1953. Shortly afterward, NACA research pilot A. Scott Crossfield exceeded Mach 2 in the plane. The NACA utilized the third D-558-2, bureau number 37975 (NACA 145), in a program evaluating the effectiveness of wing slats and leading edge devices, and examined its behavior with external stores mounted beneath its wings. All three Skyrockets were retired from flight operations in 1956. At one point, Douglas considered developing a D-558-3 hypersonic research aircraft, upon request of the Office of Naval Research, but this aircraft remained a paper study."

On September 9, 1942, a Yokosuka E14Y1 GLEN (Allied codename) reconnaissance floatplane launched by catapult from the submarine I-25 and dropped four improvised phosphorus bombs into a forest on the Oregon coast. Five months earlier, the Japanese Navy issued orders to build a new series of submarine aircraft carriers called the I-400 class. Navy planners envisioned a large fleet but eventually only three were completed, I-400 through I-402. The three ships in this class were the largest submarines ever built until the \"USS Lafayette\" sailed in 1962. An I-400 boat displaced 5,970 metric tons (6,560 tons) submerged and it cruised at 18.7 knots surfaced. These ships could travel 60,000 km (43,000 mi) carrying three Seirans in waterproof compartments. A class of smaller Japanese submarines called the AM class was also modified to carry two Seirans."

Chief engineer Ozaki confronted an ambitious challenge: develop an aircraft to haul a 250 kg (400 lb) bomb, or an 800 kg (1,288 lb) bomb or torpedo, and fly at least 474 kph (294 mph) with jettisonable floats in place, or 559 kph (347 mph) without floats. The navy also stipulated that assembling and launching the three M6A1s should require no more than 30 minutes. To fit inside a 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) diameter, cylinder-shaped hangar, Ozaki designed the main wing spar to rotate 90\u00b0 once the deck crew removed the two floats. After rotating the wings, the crew folded them back to lie flat against the fuselage. About 2/3 of the each side of the horizontal stabilizer also folded down, likewise the tip of the vertical stabilizer. Deck crews stored the floats and their support pylons in separate compartments."

The Navy was so pleased with the initial results that it ordered production to start even before Aichi delivered the remaining prototypes, and two land-based M6A1-K Nanzan trainers. However, progress virtually stopped after a major earthquake severely disrupted the production line in December 1944. Boeing B-29 bomber raids further disrupted the project. As the war deteriorated in March 1945, the Navy curtailed the submarine program. The first I-400 was finished on December 30, 1944, and the I-401 followed a week later. But I-402 was converted into a submarine fuel tanker and work ended on I-404 and 405. With the submarine fleet now reduced, the Navy required fewer Seirans so this program was also curtailed. Using parts on hand, Aichi eventually built 26 Seirans (including prototypes) and two Nanzan trainers."

The combined force consisted of the submarine carriers I-400 and I-401, two AM class submarines, the I-13 and I-14, and 10 Seiran bombers. During sea trials, the units practiced hard to reduce the assembly time for the Seiran. Eventually, the crews could launch three aircraft (albeit without floats) in less than 15 minutes! There was a major drawback for without floats, the Seiran pilot could not safely land on the water. His only option was to ditch the bomber near the submarine and await rescue. The aircraft would obviously be lost."

Japanese Navy planners chose to strike the locks of the Panama Canal using the 631st Air Corps embarked aboard the 1st Submarine Flotilla. Planners assigned ten Seirans to strike the Gatun Locks with six torpedoes and four bombs. The pilots studied a large-scale model of the lock system and memorized important features of the canal, just as their predecessors did before attacking Pearl Harbor. During these preparations, the Japanese decided to strike first at the U. S. Navy fleet anchored at Ulithi Atoll. On June 25, 1945, Ariizumi received orders for Operation Hikari. This plan required six Seirans and four Nakajima C6N1 MYRT reconnaissance aircraft (see NASM collection). The I-13 and I-14 would carry two MYRTs each and offload them at Truk Island. The MYRT pilots would take off and scout the American fleet at Ulithi, relaying target information to the Seiran crews. The six Seirans would carry out kamikaze attacks on the most important targets-American aircraft carriers and troop transports."

No production drawings survive and the team conducted exhaustive research into how various aircraft systems operated in order accurately reconstruct a number of missing components. They found interesting design features built into the Seiran that ranged in engineering quality from the ingenious to the seemingly absurd. This artifact also bore witness to the difficult working conditions that plagued the Japanese aviation industry at the end of the war. Quality and workmanship were seriously lacking because of extensive damage to equipment and factories and the lack of skilled, professional workers (many were high school students). A metal flap bore damage-probably the result of a bombing raid-hastily covered with fabric patches. They found the interior of fuel tanks contaminated with paper documents. Basic fit and alignment of parts was also poor in many places. Someone, possibly a Japanese student, scratched a complete English alphabet inside one wing panel. Technicians found more graffiti in various areas on the airframe."

In June, the two men formed the Quickie Aircraft Corporation to produce and sell complete kits to build the aircraft. They flew the airplane to the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in June where the Quickie drew intense public interest and won the Outstanding New Design award.

A builder cuts foam cores for the various components and covers them with resin and fiberglass cloth. Rutan envisioned powering the Quickie with an Onan industrial generator engine that developed 22 horsepower but many builders found this motor too weak. A 2-place version, propelled by a 64 horsepower engine and called the Q-2, was also developed. The Q-200, equipped with a modified lower wing and powered by an 85 horsepower engine, also flew.

This three-seat monoplane flew in the spring of 1928 with a 90-hp Curtiss OX-5, the engine that had powered Curtiss JN-4 Jenny trainers in World War I. Robins offered flight characteristics as straightforward as their appealing lines and modest performance. A distinctive feature (shared with Fairchild cabin monoplanes of the period) was side cockpit windows that ran almost to the floor."

Then, in 1927, Charles Lindbergh's historic flight from New York to Paris showed the world that the era of the monoplane was truly at hand. His Ryan Spirit of St. Louis-like the Stinson SM, Bellanca Columbia, Fairchild FC-2, and Ford Tri-Motor-all featured a single high wing and fully enclosed cabin. The Robin, built to the same formula, was conventional in structure with a welded fuselage built of rugged steel tubing that was rectangular in cross section. Except for the cowling, the airplane was entirely fabric-covered. Orange with black trim was a common factory color scheme. More than 300 Robins were fitted with the surplus OX-5 and sold to the civil market at $4,000. Others were powered by the 170-hp Curtiss Challenger (a six-cylinder, twin-row radial engine that was less than satisfactory) and the excellent 165-hp Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind. These later versions, with the added expense of new engines, sold for almost twice the price of the lethargic OX-5 Robin, but offered substantially better performance."

There to greet the exhausted fliers on the evening of July 1 were 35,000 wildly cheering spectators. Among the dangers they had faced were severe thunderstorms and an electrical fire. During the flight, Fred and Al Key took turns manning the controls and sleeping on the extra fuel tank behind them in the cabin. They received food, fuel, and supplies 432 times through a sliding roof hatch from another Robin. A metal catwalk on the forward section of the aircraft made in-flight maintenance and lubrication of the engine possible. Their Wright Whirlwind engine consumed 6.500 gallons of gasoline, at a rate of 10 gallons per hour, and 300 gallons of oil. Their estimated ground track was 52,320 miles, or more than twice the circumference of the earth."

On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Baker and Able (a female rhesus monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The capsule was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960."

In 1910, famed publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst announced his offer of a $50,000-prize for a U.S. transcontinental flight in thirty days or less. Rodgers' Wright EX biplane was named the Vin Fiz after his sponsor's grape soda product. He left Sheepshead Bay, New York, on September 17, 1911. A \"hangar\" car, a rolling workshop filled with spare parts to repair and maintain the airplane, followed along. The flight was punctuated by numerous stops, delays, and accidents. When Hearst's 30-day time limit expired, Rodgers had only reached Kansas City, Missouri. Undaunted, he continued on, determined to make the first transcontinental airplane flight whether he received the money or not. He arrived in Pasadena, California, to a hero's welcome, 49 days after setting out. Although Pasadena was the official end of the coast-to-coast journey, Rodgers flew on to Long Beach to complete the flight at the shore of the Pacific Ocean. The total distance covered was 6,914 km (4,321 mi) in 82 hours, 4 minutes, total flying time at an average speed of 82.4 kph (51.5 mph)."

Rodgers had a rich personal heritage of exploration and adventure. He was a descendant of Commodore Mathew Calbraith Perry, famous for opening Japan to U.S. trade in 1853, his brother Oliver Hazard Perry, and Commodore John Rodgers, all of whom had historic naval careers. Rodgers's interest in attending the U.S. Naval Academy was thwarted by his deafness, a condition resulting from a serious bout with scarlet fever as a young boy. Given his nautical lineage, he was an avid sailor and was elected to the prestigious New York Yacht Club in 1902. Rodgers had a love of speed, which he pursued through the recently introduced technologies of motorcycles and automobiles."

His cousin, John, a Naval Academy graduate, had been selected to learn to fly the Navy's newly purchased Wright airplane, and was sent to the Wright factory and flying school in Dayton, Ohio, in March 1911. On a visit to his cousin during his training, Cal was immediately hooked on flying, and soon began flight instruction. Shortly thereafter, with his cousin, he ordered a new Wright Model B airplane. A quick study, Rodgers was already flying public exhibitions in Ohio and Indiana with his new aircraft in July. On August 7, 1911, he passed his flight tests for pilot's license number 49, issued by the Aero Club of America. On August 10, he arrived in Chicago to compete in the Chicago International Aviation Meet at Grant Park. He won the duration contest, and along with his performance in other events, earned total prize money of $11,285, and instant celebrity."

While still in Chicago, he secured financial backing from the Armour Company, a local firm which was then introducing a new grape-flavored soft drink called Vin Fiz. Armour provided a special train, emblazoned with the Vin Fiz logo, with cars for the accommodation of Rodgers's family and his support crew, and a \"hangar\" car, which was a rolling workshop, filled with spare parts to repair and maintain the airplane over the course of the flight. There was even an automobile on board to pick up Rodgers after forced landings away from the rail line. The pilot would receive five dollars for every mile he flew east of the Mississippi River and four dollars for every mile west of the river. Rodgers agreed to pay for the fuel, oil, spare parts, his mechanics, and the airplane itself, which the Wright Company agreed to build. Chief mechanic on the flight was Charles Taylor, who had worked for the Wright brothers since 1901 and had built the engine for the Wright Flyer, the world's first airplane that flew at Kitty Hawk in 1903."

It was powered by a 35-horsepower, Wright vertical four-cylinder engine, and it carried enough fuel for a maximum of 3\u00bd hours flying time."

Undaunted, Rodgers continued on, determined to make the first transcontinental airplane flight whether he received the money or not. Upon leaving Kansas City, he flew due south to Texas, and then made his way across the southern U.S. border toward Pasadena, California, the official termination point of the flight. Rodgers continued to experience frequent mechanical failures, damage to the airplane in hard landings, and weather delays. Trouble arose again on November 3, shortly after passing over Imperial Junction, California, less than 320 km (200 mi) from the finish. At 1,200 m (4,000 ft), an engine cylinder exploded, damaging one of the wings and driving steel shards into Rodgers's right arm. He struggled to regain control of the Vin Fiz and, amazingly, managed to glide the 10 km (6 mi) back to Imperial Junction and land safely. The engine and airplane were repaired a day later, and despite his painful injury, Rodgers departed for Pasadena once again on November 4. Further engine problems forced him down in Banning, California, about half way to his final destination. On November 5 he was airborne again, and after brief stops in Beaumont and Pomona, he arrived in Pasadena to a hero's welcome, 49 days after setting out from Sheepshead Bay."

                "content": "Although Pasadena was the official end of the coast-to-coast journey, Rodgers wanted to fly all the way to the Pacific shore to complete the flight. Several coastal towns bid for the honor, and Long Beach was the final selection. They agreed to pay Rodgers $1,000, plus part of the gate receipts of an exhibition of the Vin Fiz after arrival. Rodgers took off from Pasadena for the short 37 km (23 mi) trip to Long Beach on November 12. Minutes into the flight, engine failure forced him down near Covina Junction. Repairs to a broken fuel line had him back in the air that afternoon. But again, just a short time after takeoff, near Compton, California, Rodgers was down. This time it was a serious crash. The airplane was severely damaged and Rodgers was badly hurt. It took several weeks to make the Vin Fiz airworthy again and for Rodgers to recover from his injuries. On December 10, yet needing crutches to move about on his still healing ankle, Rodgers boarded his battered aircraft, determined to fly the Vin Fiz all the way to the Pacific Ocean. As at Pasadena, Rodgers's arrival was an organized public event and a large crowd gathered at Long Beach to welcome him. The remainder of the great adventure met without incident and Rodgers landed to cheering crowds. To create a photo opportunity for the press and the spectators the Vin Fiz was rolled into the surf, allowing the Pacific to lap over it wheels. The 6,914 km (4,321 mi) were covered in 82 hours, 4 minutes, total flying time at an average speed of 82.4 kph (51.5 mph). Cal Rodgers had secured his place in aviation history. (Robert Fowler began another west-to-east transcontinental flight on October 19, this time taking a southern route to avoid the mountains. He arrived in Jacksonville, Florida, on February 8, 1912, completing the trip in more than twice as many days as Rodgers.)"

                "content": "Rodgers and his wife liked Pasadena and decided to stay. He kept the Vin Fiz and a second airplane, a two-seat Wright Model B, at nearby Dominguez Field. He made exhibition flights with the Vin Fiz and took up passengers and gave flight instruction with the Model B. He later moved the airplanes to Long Beach and operated from there. On April 3, 1912, Rodgers was airborne in the Model B, making a test flight after some tuning of the engine in preparation for another passenger ride. Witnesses observed a steep dive as Rodgers apparently attempted to avoid a flock of seagulls. In the next instant he was seen struggling with the controls just before the airplane crashed into the surf, only one hundred yards from his landing spot after the last leg of the transcontinental flight in December. Rodgers was killed instantly. Various causes for the accident were put forth, ranging from a seagull jamming the controls to Rodgers's recklessness or carelessness as a pilot. The precise cause remains undetermined. The wreckage of Rodgers's Model B was acquired by one of his mechanics, Frank Shaffer, and his partner Jesse Brabazon. They rebuilt it and flew for approximately one year until it was destroyed in a crash while being piloted by Brabazon's friend, Andrew Drew, who was killed."

                "content": "The Vin Fiz was acquired after Cal's death by his cousin, Lt. John Rodgers, USN. He offered it to the Smithsonian Institution, but it was not accepted on the grounds that it was very similar to the recently acquired Wright Military Flyer. It then passed to Rodgers's wife, Mabel, who, not long after Cal's death, married Charles Wiggin. They exhibited and flew the Vin Fiz publicly for two years, until Rodgers's mother was awarded possession of the airplane in 1914 in a court ruling regarding Cal's estate. The history of the airplane becomes somewhat murky at this point. According to Charles Taylor, the Wright mechanic who assisted Rodgers on the transcontinental flight, Rodgers's mother shipped the Vin Fiz to the Wright factory in Dayton, Ohio, for refurbishment. Either unable or unwilling to pay for the work, she allowed the airplane to languish at the Wright factory and it was destroyed in 1916 after the company was sold. But this version of events is at odds with the fact that Rodgers's mother had the Vin Fiz restored and donated it to the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1917. The airplane was later acquired by the Smithsonian from Carnegie in 1934."

                "content": "The probable explanation for the conflicting information lies in the misconception that there was a single Vin Fiz airframe. On the transcontinental flight, several sets of wings and a large supply of other components and spare parts were brought along on the support train. Rodgers's airplane was repaired and rebuilt many times during the trip. By the time the wheels of the Vin Fiz were rolled into the Pacific at Long Beach, almost nothing of the airplane that took off from Sheepshead Bay remained. As a result, at the end of the journey, there were enough flown, genuine Vin Fiz parts to make up more than one airplane. Charles Taylor was probably accurate when he stated that the Vin Fiz sent to the Wright factory (i.e., the intact airplane that Mabel and Charles Wiggin flew in 1912-14) was destroyed. The airplane that ended up at the Carnegie Institute, and then the Smithsonian, was very likely reconstructed from the parts left over from the many repairs and rebuilds during the flight. Thus, the airplane in the NASM collection is genuine in that it is comprised of components that, at various points, were part of the Vin Fiz during the historic coast-to-coast flight."

At the Smithsonian, an original Wright engine of the correct type, but not associated with the flight nor with Rodgers, was put on the airplane. In 1960, the Smithsonian fully restored the Vin Fiz. In 1996, when it was part of a traveling Smithsonian exhibition, a new wooden mock-up engine was made and placed on the airplane. This was done to reduce potential wear and tear on the artifact caused by repeated removal of the heavy, original engine during assembly and disassembly of the airplane on the many stops of the exhibition tour. The mock-up engine remains on the Vin Fiz."

Named the Model 206L-1 LongRanger II, it introduced Bell's revolutionary new Noda-Matic suspension system for the transmission and stretched the JetRanger's fuselage 26 inches. The additional space left room for a third side window, the most recognizable visual feature of the LongRanger. Along with the JetRanger, the 206 series is one most familiar lines of civil helicopters in the western world."

However, Bell executives recognized the potential of the configuration as the next generation replacement for its venerable Model 47 series [see NASM collection. In 1966, Bell introduced a re-engined and substantially reconfigured 206 as a commercial replacement for its successful reciprocating 47J Ranger VIP transport [see NASM collection]. Known as the JetRanger, it attracted much attention, if not sales. Military oders soon overshadowed commercial production as the Army acquired them under the OH-58A designation to overcome production shortfalls and cost over runs in the OH-6s desperately needed in Vietnam. Though not as durable or maneuverable as the OH-6, the OH-58's advantages in reliability and maintainability associated with Bell's trademark two-bladed teetering main rotor made it a mainstay in the final years of conflict in Southeast Asia and ultimately led to its superseding its earlier competitor in scout and light attack role up to the present day. The US Navy also procured the 206 as the TH-57A Sea Rangers for use as a trainer."

However, the petroleum industry demanded greater internal capacity over the four passengers carried by the 206. Bell responded with the seven-place 206L LongRanger."

In reality, for much of the 1970s and '80s, the JetRanger and LongRanger were the dominant helicopter models in North America for VIP transport, natural resource exploitation, film and television production, and law enforcement. By the 1990s, stagnation in the offshore market and an influx of European competitors began to limit Bell's domination of the light turbine utility helicopter market and the company responded first a four-bladed version (Model 407), and then with twin-engine (Model 427) and instrument certified (Model 429) versions. In 2010, Bell announced the production termination of the venerable JetRanger in favor of these more robust models, and in the process, acceded the lower end of the commercial market to relative newcomer Robinson [see NASM collection]."

                "content": "Determined to beat Australian adventurer Dick Smith's solo attempt in JetRanger to fly the first helicopter around the world, H. Ross Perot, Jr. and Jay Coburn departed Fort Worth, Texas on September 1, 1982, almost a month after Smith had departed. However, Smith, with limited funds, undertook his adventure in stages and did not complete his flight until the following year. Perot and Coburn, with massive logistical support, including the positioning of a container ship as a refueling point in the northern Pacific, completed their voyage in 29 days, 3 hours, and 8 minutes. For the trip, the LongRanger had full navigation equipment, survival gear and emergency items, pop-out floats, and a 151-gallon auxiliary fuel tank in place of the rear seat. The additional five-hour endurance enabled the Spirit of Texas to fly eight hours without refueling. The trip took 246.5 flight hrs at an average ground speed of 117 mph. The LongRanger is capable of a maximum speed of 150 mph."

The first prototype Bf 109 flew in September 1935, powered by a Rolls Royce Kestrel 695-hp engine because suitable German aircraft engines were not yet available-engine development had been hindered by the Versailles Treaty. Follow-on prototypes of the Bf 109 used several other engines until Messerschmitt and the Air Ministry settled on the Daimler-Benz DB 600 series inverted-V, liquid-cooled engine. (Note: The Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, abbreviated Bf, is the company that built and flew the prototype Bf 109. The firm was renamed Messerschmitt AG in July 1938 but many official German publications continued to refer to the airplane as the 'Bf 109.')"

Five Bf 109s took part and demonstrated outstanding climbing, diving, and maneuverability, along with exceptional speed. As these impressive demonstrations were taking place, the Luftwaffe was delivering twenty-four '109 fighters to Spain for the Condor Legion. By the time England declared war on Germany, German pilots had battle-tested the '109 in aerial combat and Messerschmitt AG was busily mass-producing the 'E' model."

The Spitfire was slightly faster and definitely more maneuverable, but its performance at altitude was inferior. There was little difference in piloting skill between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force but in 1940 during the Battle of Britain, the RAF usually fought over friendly territory. The Bf 109s limited fuel capacity reduced fighting time over Britain to about twenty minutes. Many '109 pilots exhausted their fuel and crashed into the icy waters of the English Channel."

Army Air Forces heavy bombers steadily increased. The Luftwaffe pressed the '109 into service intercepting the massive bomber formations, battling heavy defensive crossfire and increasing opposition from escort fighters. In most air encounters over Europe, Allied pilots expected the 109s to appear for a fight."

When production stopped, Messerschmitt had produced far greater numbers of the 'G' than any other model. The company built 21,000 by the end of 1944. Nicknamed 'Gustav' and powered by a DB 605 engine, the 'G' carried a variety of machine guns, bombs, and cannons and occasionally, two 20mm MG 151/20 weapons slung beneath the wings. The latter combination was ideal for bomber interception but severely reduced air-to-air combat effectiveness."

In 1995, Jim Kitchens, an archivist at Maxwell Air Force Base, discovered a report on the defection of Ren\u00e9 Darbois on July 25, 1944. Darbois was a native of German-annexed Lorraine who claimed he was forced to fly in the Luftwaffe. He took off in the NASM BF 109G-6 on his first combat mission and proceeded directly to the airfield at Caserta, Italy. He landed and walked into the custody of the U. S. Army Air Forces 72nd Liaison Squadron. In 1989 Museum specialist Tom Dietz discovered the Gustav's Werk-Nummer to be 160756. The number falls within the range of airframes manufactured at Messerschmitt's Regensburg plant in summer or fall 1943. Messerschmitt built this particular model specifically to operate in tropical and desert climates. For desert operations, mechanics installed a sand filter but none was found with the NASM Gustav."

Later, the collection was moved to the museum's storage facility at Silver Hill, Maryland, near Washington, D.C."

The main material is a .635-centimeter (1/4-inch) sandwich of paper honeycomb and graphite fiber, carefully molded and cured in an oven. The entire airframe was constructed without using metal, and weighs only 425 kilograms (939 pounds). Voyager took more than 22,000 work hours and more than 18 months to construct. The long, thin main wing was so flexible that the wing tip deflected upward 0.9 to 1 .5 meters (3 to 5 feet) while the aircraft was in flight. The purpose of the winglets was to raise the fuel vent from the three outboard wing tanks high enough to keep fuel from draining out onto the ground. The cabin area and cockpit were side by side within the fuselage."

The pilot shifted fuel from tank to tank during the flight to keep the airplane in balance. The 3,181 kilograms (7,011 pounds) of fuel aboard at takeoff amounted to 72.3 percent of its gross takeoff weight. At the end of the flight only 48 kilograms (106 pounds) of fuel remained. Two engines, one at each end of the fuselage, powered the aircraft. The highly efficient 110-hp, liquid-cooled rear engine, a Teledyne Continental IOL-200, ran during the entire flight except for four minutes when a fuel problem caused a temporary shutdown. The 130-hp, air-cooled front engine, a Teledyne Continental 0-240, was used for a total of 70 hours and 8 minutes during the initial, heavyweight stage of the flight, and also while climbing over weather and at other critical times. Voyager was equipped with Hartzell constant-speed, variable-pitch aluminum propellers that proved to be a critical factor in stretching the aircraft's range enough to bring it home. These propellers were designed, built, and delivered in only 17 days after one of the original propellers failed."

Both winglets were damaged during takeoff when the wing tips dragged along the runway. Soon after takeoff, an attempt was made to deliberately dislodge the damaged winglets over Edwards Air Force Base so that if structural damage occurred to the aircraft's fuel tanks, it could land as soon as possible. To dislodge the winglets, the crew increased flight speed and maneuvered the airplane to build up side forces sufficiently high to break them free. About eight kilometers (five miles) from the base the right winglet was dislodged and fell into someone's yard. It is now in storage at the Museum's Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland. The other winglet was also successfully dislodged, but was never found."

Flying Voyager, Rutan and Yeager established eight absolute and world class records. On the second day of the flight over the Pacific Ocean, they were guided by meteorologists through the edges of Typhoon Marge to obtain a \"slingshot effect\" from tailwinds. These winds increased Voyager's ground speed to 130 knots (150 mph)."

Over the Atlantic Ocean near Brazil, a violent storm at night turned Voyager on a 90-degree bank, but the flight through the Caribbean was pleasingly uneventful. A final scare occurred on the last morning when the strainer on a small fuel pump and an air pocket in the line starved the rear engine of fuel and it stopped. The aircraft lost 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) of altitude while Rutan and Yeager made an emergency restart of the front engine. While the aircraft struggled to climb, the air block was overcome and the rear engine was restarted. The aircraft leveled off at 1,067 meters (3,500 feet) and they landed a few hours later at Edwards Air Force Base."

The other pilot in the cabin area rested, managed the logistics support tasks of the flight, or provided navigation and flight-monitoring assistance. In reality, neither pilot found the time or comfort for much rest, yet both were in remarkably good condition at the end of the flight. Voyager made one last flight on January 6, 1987, when Yeager and Rutan flew it home to Mojave, California."

Virtually a Wasp of reduced dimensions, the Wasp Jr. followed closely the details of construction throughout. The Wasp Jr., originally rated at 224 kW (300 hp), was first type certificated in January 1930. Designed for light transports, trainers, sport aircraft, and helicopters, number of R-985 models were made, most at 298 kW (400 hp) or more power. The R-985 powered a wide variety and large number of military and commercial aircraft, making it one of the most successful reciprocating engines ever built in its power class."

Modifications of the A-2 by the Navy led to re-designations of E-1 and later AX-1. These modifications, done at the Curtiss plant at Hammondsport, New York, included moving the seats from the lower wing to the float and enclosing the crew area with a fabric-covered framework, giving the aircraft the appearance of a short-hull flying boat."

The Model F perfected the flying boat design with the incorporation of a V hull, supplanting the less efficient flat-bottomed hull of the Model E.

Curtiss, with assistance from Royal Navy engineer Lt. John Cyril Porte, further enhanced the ability of waterborne aircraft to get off the water by constructing a mid-way \"step\" on the bottom of the float or hull. Water has adhesive qualities, especially when running over a curved surface, and early seaplanes had difficulty getting \"unstuck\" from the water, especially in calm seas. The addition of the step helped break up the water flow under the hull enabling the flying boat to get airborne more easily. Curtiss also added breather tubes to the flying boat hull. These were small copper tubes that ran from the inside of the hull to the undersurface step to relieve the low pressure under the hull and assisted the aircraft in becoming airborne."

Its rotary was sufficiently different than that first developed by the highly successful Seguin brothers of the Societe des Moteurs Gnome, also of Paris, that it circumvented relevant Gnome patents; but was taken over by Gnome in 1914. Because Le Rhone products were in some ways superior to Gnome, its design engineers were permitted to continue development during World War I, resulting in large scale production of various nine cylinder engines."

About 8,500 Super Cubs were built at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and they proved popular as private and utility aircraft and as military trainers."

A scintillation counter used to detect gamma radiation is in the rear of the airplane."

                "content": "The Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) operated PA-18 Super Cub N1872P in its uranium exploration program carried out in the western United States during the 1950s. As part of the fleet of 10 airplanes, it made radiometric surveys, including Isorad mapping, of the terrain for use in the ground-based laboratories and evaluation centers. The bulk of this program was carried on for about three years during the mid-1950s in the quest for additional sources of uranium rich deposits for the expanding nuclear industry in the military and civilian markets."

                "content": "The PA-18 Super Cub series airplane was the last Piper production airplane type to carry the Cub nameplate. The first upgraded version of the J-3 was the PA-11 Cub Special which was distinguishable by the closed engine cowling over its 65 hp Continental engine. Soon a Continental C-90 AF engine was added. More important, the PA-11 was the first Cub that could be flown solo from the front seat. The front seat was higher and more forward because of the movement of fuel tanks from the nose to the left wing root section of the aircraft and the resulting change in the center of gravity. The PA-11 was first flown in August 1946 and a total of 1,428 were built between 1947 and 1950."

                "content": "The PA-18 Super Cub was a strengthened PA-11 with the ability to support up to a 150 hp engine. Externally the only noticeable structural change was a slight additional rounding of the vertical fin and rudder. The PA-18 was introduced in November 1949 in three basic versions: the Standard, the Deluxe with starter and generator, and the Agricultural version. The famous bear cub logo was replaced by a circular medallion in which the name Piper was crossed vertically and horizontally using the middle \"P\" as the common letter for both positions. The standard Cub Yellow paint scheme was replaced annually with changes of colors and trims. The PA-18 was produced at the Lock Haven factory until that plant was closed in 1983, but production resumed in 1988 at the new Piper facility in Vero Beach, Florida, under new ownership. About 8,500 civilian Super Cubs were delivered and more than 1,800 airplanes were also delivered to the U.S. and several foreign military services as L-18Cs and L-21s for liaison, training, transport and target tugs work."

This airplane, powered by a 150 hp Lycoming engine, was delivered to Boyd Aero Service, the Piper distributor in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and it became the property of the A.E.C. on January 26, 1955. The decision to perform these surveys from the air was made on the basis of a comparison of the costs to operate an airborne system to the costs of doing it by conventional geological methods or by the use of ground based vehicles. The rough and sometimes inaccessible terrain to be surveyed made the airborne approach a logical choice based on accessibility, cost and time. The low and slow Super Cub, priced at only $6,000, proved to be superior to the only emerging helicopter which had yet to establish a consistent record of reliability and was expensive."

The pilot was required to have a commercial pilot rating with at least 500 hours of flight time and was also required to be a licensed airplane & powerplant mechanic (A&P) so that he could maintain the aircraft in the field. The section chief, who was also the airborne geologist/observer, was required to have sufficient pilot training to be able to handle the airplane in the event of an emergency. The geological instrumentation in the aircraft consisted principally of scintillation measurement equipment, special recording equipment and cameras to record the scintillation profiles, and maps for ground laboratory use. Survey altitudes usually ranged from 25 to 100 feet and required excellent low speed maneuverability near cliff sides and box canyons. The Super Cub boasted an extraordinary safety record in this rugged terrain with only two accidents, neither one with serious injury, occurring during the entire program."

It was transferred to and accessioned by the National Air and Space Museum in 1976. The airplane is currently on display at the Museum's Stephen F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia."

This design was selected as the best combination of a reusable orbiter, a disposable external tank, and two recoverable solid rocket boosters after it became evident that a completely reusable system would be too large and too costly. The model depicts the orbiter Columbia and the Shuttle \"stack\" poised for launch on the mobile launch platform and crawler transporter. Rockwell International, Space Shuttle prime contractor, presented this model to the Museum shortly after the first mission in 1981."

In place of the two windows are two video screens that show the actual Lunar landscape as filmed from Apollo 17. In much the same view from the simulator, two astronauts would stand before these windows as they controled the gradual descent of the LM to the lunar surface. The attitude of the craft was controlled by 16 rockets situated around the outer structure of the LM. These rockets could be fired automatically by mechanical sensors or by the astronauts' inclinations. The descent to the moon was entirely dissimilar from a landing on the surface of the earth; no atmosphere was present, restricting the possibility of a diagonal glide-type landing, and also enabling the astronauts to land entirely vertically. The retro-rocket of the descent engine assured the astronauts of a gradual touchdown. The LM was specifically designed for a lunar landing; it would not have worked remotely well in the atmosphere of the Earth or in the presence of a strong gravitational field (the Moon's gravity is approximately 1/6 as strong as the Earth's at the surface)."

The Albatros D.V model was fitted with a more powerful 180-horsepower engine, but was plagued by a rash of upper-wing failures. The wings were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va.

The Albatros Werke began to build airplanes in 1910. Early in the war, the firm focused on two-seat observation types. In 1916, in response to the fading superiority of the Fokker monoplane to the French Nieuport 11 and the British de Havilland D.H.2, the German government requested the nation's aircraft companies to produce a suitable replacement for the Fokker. Albatros Werke chief designer, Robert Thelen, with his assistants Gnaedig and Schubert, offered a remarkably advanced design, the Albatros D.I. It featured a streamlined semi-monocoque fuselage, with an almost fully-enclosed in-line Mercedes engine and the propeller spinner neatly contoured into the nose of the fuselage. The D.I was quickly modified into the very similar D.II, which had the upper wing repositioned slightly to improve visibility for the pilot. Both fighters entered front-line service in the fall of 1916 and immediately demonstrated strong advantages over their Allied counterparts. Powered by a 160-horsepower Mercedes engine and armed with two machine guns, the Albatros fighters used speed and firepower to overwhelm the lighter, more maneuverable Nieuports and D.H. 2s."

The Albatros D.III was introduced early in 1917 and it met with instant acceptance by the German pilots. It was easy to fly and was an effective combat aircraft. The principal design change was the use of a narrow-chord lower wing, similar to the sesquiplane wing arrangement of the agile Nieuport fighters. This increased maneuverability as well as improving the pilot's field of view. Initially, the narrow lower wing was susceptible to frequent failure in prolonged dives, but with reinforcement of the structure and improved workmanship, the problem was ameliorated. The Albatros D.III served with great success throughout the first half of 1917."

Thelen was forced to refine the sleek Albatros design further in an effort to gain parity with the new Allied fighters. In the D.IV model, Thelen reverted to the equal-width upper and lower wings of the D.I and D.II. The nose was even more streamlined than the D.III and the rudder had a more rounded shape. An experimental geared version of the 160-horsepower Mercedes engine was fitted to the D.IV prototype. But despite its racy appearance, the performance of the D.IV was not up to that of the D.III, and the experimental geared engine was problem-ridden. Thus, no production run of the D.IV was ordered."

Initially it was powered by the same 160-horsepower Mercedes engine used in the D.III, but later it was replaced by an up-rated model that delivered approximately 180 horsepower. The major new innovation was the D.V's elliptical cross-section fuselage, compared to the flat-sided fuselage of the earlier models. Primarily because of changes in the nature of the construction of the elliptical fuselage, the D.V was approximately 32 kg (70 lb) lighter than the D.III, and this improved performance marginally. But hopes for the new version were soon undermined by a rash of upper-wing spar failures shortly after the D.V was introduced. To remedy the problem, the wing ribs and the spars were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va. Unfortunately, the necessary strengthening of the airframe made the overall weight of the D.Va 23 kg (50 lb) more than the D.III, negating the performance improvement of the newer model. The D.V and D.Va also continued to experience the same lower wing failure problems in a dive of the earlier D.III. A small auxiliary strut was added at the bottom of the outer wing struts to address the issue, but was not entirely successful. Even so, the D.Va remained in production until April 1918, when the superior Fokker D.VII appeared."

This places it in the final batch of 550 D.Vas built by the Albatros factory during the war. The last of these aircraft reached the front in April 1918. It is apparent, however, that the airplane is comprised of components from more than one Albatros. The individual wings show evidence of workmanship of different quality, suggesting that they were not produced at the same time and at the same place. Further, before restoration, there were straight crosses as well as the earlier Iron Cross national insignia on different components of the airplane."

This unit was formed at Graudenz on December 17, 1917, as part of Germany's Amerika Program, an effort to build up German strength rapidly and deliver a decisive blow to the West before American resources could be brought to bear for the Allies. Under the program, the number of German fighter units doubled. The inferred production date from the serial number of the NASM Albatros fits with the creation and equipping of Jasta 46 with Albatros fighters. Evidence that the NASM Albatros did see combat is damage from a bullet that passed through the right machine gun mount, penetrated the emergency fuel tank, and then lodged in the right magneto. The airplane was unlikely to have flown again as the fuel tank had not been repaired."

The first record of the NASM Albatros in the United States is the presentation of the airplane to the De Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco on July 13, 1919, by Congressman Julius Kahn. It is unclear how Congressman Kahn became associated with the Albatros, but a label placed with the airplane at that time credited it as a gift from the French government. Some years later, NASM curator Paul Garber learned of the Albatros at the De Young Memorial Museum. On a trip to California in January 1947, he located the airplane and approached the museum about donating it to the Smithsonian. Garber was informed that it had recently been sold at auction for $500.00 to George K. Whitney, who planned to display it at Playland near Cliff House, a local San Francisco tourist stop. After Garber explained the importance of the historic aircraft to Whitney, he agreed to donate it to the Smithsonian, with the condition that the museum pay the packing and transportation costs. After a lengthy delay until funds were available, the Albatros was moved to the museum's temporary storage facility in Park Ridge, Illinois, in August 1949. It was brought to Washington, D.C., in 1952 and remained in storage until restoration began in January 1977. The complex and meticulous rebuilding of the NASM Albatros D.Va was completed in February 1979."

They played and experimented with it extensively and even built several larger copies of the device. They also had some experience with kites. But not until 1896, prompted by the widely publicized fatal crash of famed glider pioneer Otto Lilienthal, did the Wrights begin serious study of flight. After absorbing what materials related to the subject the brothers had available locally, Wilbur wrote to the Smithsonian Institution on May 30, 1899, requesting any publications on aeronautics that it could offer."

The Wrights chose to follow Lilienthal's lead of using gliders as a stepping stone towards a practical powered airplane. The 1899 kite was built as a preliminary test device to establish the viability of the control system that they planned to use in their first full-size glider. This means of control would be a central feature of the later successful powered airplane."

                "content": "Rather than controlling the craft by altering the center of gravity by shifting the pilot's body weight as Lilienthal had done, the Wrights intended to balance their glider aerodynamically. They reasoned that if a wing generates lift when presented to an oncoming flow of air, producing differing amounts of lift on either end of the wing would cause one side to rise more than the other, which in turn would bank the entire aircraft. A mechanical means of inducing this differential lift would provide the pilot with effective lateral control of the airplane. The Wrights accomplished this by twisting, or warping, the tips of the wings in opposite directions via a series of lines attached to the outer edges of the wings that were manipulated by the pilot. The idea advanced aeronautical experimentation significantly because it provided an effective method of controlling an airplane in three-dimensional space and, because it was aerodynamically based, it did not limit the size of the aircraft as shifting body weight obviously did. The satisfactory performance of the 1899 kite demonstrated the practicality of the wing warping control system."

Beyond the issue of control, the Wrights had to grapple with developing an efficient airfoil shape and solving fundamental problems of structural design. Like the kite, these gliders were biplanes. For control of climb and descent, the gliders had forward-mounted horizontal stabilizers. Neither craft had a tail. The Wrights' home of Dayton, Ohio, did not offer suitable conditions for flying the gliders. An inquiry with the U.S. Weather Bureau identified Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with its sandy, wide-open spaces and strong, steady winds as an optimal test site. In September 1900, the Wrights made their first trip to the little fishing hamlet that they would make world famous."

They began to question seriously the aerodynamic data that they had used. Now at a critical juncture, Wilbur and Orville decided to conduct an extensive series of tests of wing shapes. They built a small wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to gather a body of accurate aerodynamic data with which to design their next glider. The heart of the Wright wind tunnel was the ingeniously designed pair of test instruments that were mounted inside. These measured coefficients of lift and drag on small model wing shapes, the terms in the equations for calculating lift and drag about which the brothers were in doubt."

The lift problems were solved, and with a few refinements to the control system (the key one being a movable vertical tail), they were able to make numerous extended controlled glides. They made between seven hundred and one thousand flights in 1902. The single best one was 191.5 m (622.5 ft) in twenty-six seconds. The brothers were now convinced that they stood at the threshold of realizing mechanical flight."

Essentially a larger and sturdier version of the 1902 glider, the only fundamentally new component of the 1903 aircraft was the propulsion system. With the assistance of their bicycle shop mechanic, Charles Taylor, the Wrights built a small, twelve-horsepower gasoline engine. While the engine was a significant enough achievement, the genuinely innovative feature of the propulsion system was the propellers. The brothers conceived the propellers as rotary wings, producing a horizontal thrust force aerodynamically. By turning an airfoil section on its side and spinning it to create an air flow over the surface, the Wrights reasoned that a horizontal \"lift\" force would be generated that would propel the airplane forward. The concept was one of the most original and creative aspects of the Wrights' aeronautical work. The 1903 airplane was fitted with two propellers mounted behind the wings and connected to the engine, centrally located on the bottom wing, via a chain-and-sprocket transmission system."

A number of problems with the engine transmission system delayed the first flight attempt until mid-December. After winning the toss of a coin to determine which brother would make the first try, Wilbur took the pilot's position and made an unsuccessful attempt on December 14th, damaging the Flyer slightly. Repairs were completed for a second attempt on December 17. It was now Orville's turn. At 10:35 a.m. the Flyer lifted off the beach at Kitty Hawk for a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft). Three more flights were made that morning, the brothers alternating as pilot. The second and third were in the range of two hundred feet. With Wilbur at the controls, the fourth and last flight covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds. With this final long, sustained effort, there was no question the Wrights had flown."

The airplane was uncrated, for the first time since Kitty Hawk, in the summer of 1916, when Orville repaired and reassembled the airplane for brief exhibition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Several other brief displays followed. It was exhibited at the New York Aero Show in 1917, at a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in Dayton in 1918, at the New York Aero Show in 1919, and at the National Air Races in Dayton in 1924.

The remaining 1903 fabric that was on the airplane when it flew was saved and portions of it still exist in various places. During World War II, the airplane was kept in an underground storage facility near the village of Corsham, approximately 160 km (100 miles) from London, where various British national treasures were secured. The Flyer was not stored in the London subway as has been often asserted. The airplane was returned to the United States in 1948 and formally donated to the Smithsonian Institution in an elaborate ceremony on December 17, the 45th anniversary of the flights, and it has been on public display there ever since."

It was completely disassembled, the parts thoroughly cleaned and preserved, and all new fabric covering applied. A careful search was made to locate new fabric that matched the original as closely as possible. When the fabric was replaced in 1927, it was sewn on in a slightly different way than originally done by the brothers in 1903. When stitching the new fabric in 1985, a large section of original flown 1903 wing covering was available and used as a pattern, ensuring the accuracy of the 1985 restoration."

The new fighter was capable of reaching speeds of more than 175 mph, and could carry five 11-kg (24-lb) bombs under each wing, with either one 225-kg (500-lb) bomb or one 155-liter (41-gallon) fuel tank beneath the fuselage.

The next model, the P-12B, was an upgraded version with Frise ailerons and a shorter landing gear. Ninety were produced. In June 1930, the Army Air Corps contracted for 131 P-12C models, which incorporated the P-12B airframe with a ring cowl and a cross-axle landing gear. Although the last thirty-five of the order were identified D models, they were identical to the P-12C. The naval equivalent was the F4B-2."

The Navy contracted for seventy-five F4B-3s; the first airplane was delivered on Christmas Eve in 1931. Built for the Army as the P-12E, the new version represented Boeing's largest Army contract since the MB-3A in 1921. Of the 135 ordered, 110 were delivered as P-12Es. The remaining twenty-five were delivered as P-12Fs, employing Pratt & Whitney SR-1340G engines for increased high altitude performance."

Essentially an F4B-3 with a broader chord fin and a larger headrest for an inflatable life raft, the F4B-4 was first ordered in April 1931, and the last of ninety-two aircraft were delivered on February 28, 1933. Twenty-one of these airplanes were assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. The F4B-4 maintained the good flight characteristics of the earlier versions despite greater weight and increased power. Only when overloaded and at maximum speed did the F4B-4 exhibit any instability."

Model 281, from which the F4B-3 and P-12E were developed, was sold to China where it was shot down by the Japanese after downing two of its three attackers."

The only difference from the standard Navy configuration is the absence of a tail hook. Number 9241 was shipped from the Boeing factory in Seattle on December 20, 1932, arriving nine days later at the North Island Air Station in San Diego, California. This F4B-4 was assigned as the number two aircraft in Marine Fighting Squadron 10, and served there until July 1933. All the F4B-4s of the squadron were transferred to VF-9M at Quantico, Virginia, where 9241 flew until the F4Bs were replaced by more modern Grumman F3F-2s. The airplane then served as a trainer until purchased by the Bureau of Air Commerce and was stricken from the Navy inventory on July 31, 1939. Shortly thereafter it was purchased by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation and later re-sold to private owners. Number 9241 was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 by its last owner, Ray Hylan, of Rochester, New York. It is now in its former colors as airplane number 21 of Marine Fighting Squadron VF-9M."

An important design objective was light weight, which was achieved through the extensive use of aluminum and magnesium alloys in the cylinders and crankcase, and a hollow crankshaft. Also like all Roberts engines it operated on a two-stroke cycle operation to reduce parts count. Between 1911 and 1912, Roberts engines were used by many noted exhibition pilots, and more Roberts engines were said to be built than by Hall-Scott and Curtiss combined during this period."

Mosely received dual instruction from Downwind Jackson (who became a character in the comic strip) and took his private pilot flight test in it. Former National Air and Space Museum curator Robert B. Meyer soloed in the aircraft in 1939; 48 years later Meyer flew it again at the Antique Aero Squadron Fly In at Horn Point, Maryland."

Students continued to fly the Fleet as part of the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP), a government-funded instruction program for potential military pilots prior to and during World War II.

The Taylor E-2, Piper J-2, Aeronca C-3, and Cessna 140 followed but the Fleet continued to fill the gap between these small civilian trainers and heavier or military trainers. The Fleet was also a popular sport aircraft; veteran pilot Paul Mantz set a record of 46 outside loops in one. It was completed at the Fleet Aircraft Company, of Buffalo, New York (at the time solely owned by Major Fleet), on May 14, 1929."

                "content": "The Surveyor series was designed to carry out soft landings on the Moon and provide data about its surface and possible atmosphere. These were the first U.S. probes to soft-land on the Moon. Once landed they provided detailed pictures of the surface by means of a TV camera carried on each of the spacecraft. Later Surveyors carried the instrumented soil mechanics surface scoop seen on the artifact. These were used to study the mechanical properties of lunar soil. Some of the spacecraft were also equipped to perform simple chemical analyses on lunar soil by means of alpha particle scattering. There were seven Surveyor launches starting in May, 1966, all launched by the Atlas-Centaur rocket. All but two successfully achieved program goals returning over 88,000 high resolution photographs and invaluable detailed data on the nature and strength of the lunar surface."

The main objectives of the Surveyors were to obtain close-up images of the lunar surface and to determine if the terrain was safe for manned landings. Each Surveyor was equipped with a television camera. In addition, Surveyors 3 and 7 each carried a soil mechanics surface sampler scoop which dug trenches and was used for soil mechanics tests and Surveyors 5, 6, and 7 had magnets attached to the footpads and an alpha scattering instrument for chemical analysis of the lunar material. The following Surveyor missions took place."

The first three orbited around the Moon's equator and provided detailed photographic coverage of the primary Apollo landing sites, including stereo images. Because of the success of these earlier missions, the final two Lunar Orbiters were placed into a polar orbit so that virtually the entire surface of the Moon was mapped. In addition to images of the Apollo landing sites, Lunar Orbiter provided many breathtaking photographs, including features on the farside."

It was approved in 1960 to place probes in orbit around the Moon for satellite mapping. This project, originally not intended to support Apollo, was reconfigured in 1962 and 1963 to further the presidential mandate by mapping the surface. In addition to a powerful camera that could send photographs to Earth tracking stations, it carried three scientific experiments-selnodesy (the Lunar equivalent of geodesy), meteoroid detection, and radiation measurement. It helped to scout the lunar surface, down to one-meter resolution, and identify potential landing sites. The spacecraft allowed NASA mission planners to select the safest, but most scientifically interesting landing sites for the Apollo missions."

While the returns from these spacecraft interested scientists in and of themselves, they were critical to Apollo. NASA launched the five Lunar Orbiter satellites between 10 August 1966 and 1 August 1967, all successfully achieving their objectives. In total, they mapped roughly 99 percent of the lunar surface. Lunar Orbiter 1 became the first spacecraft to take a picture of the Earth from the Moon, preempting the famous \"Earthrise\" photograph of Apollo 8 by more than two years. But this Lunar Orbiter image, for all of its significance did not have the salience of the more famous image in part because it was not full color. At the completion of the third mission, moreover, the Apollo planners announced that they had sufficient data to press on with an astronaut landing, and were able to use the last two missions for other activities. They conducted more general scientific surveys and also mapped the lunar gravitational field. For example, Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and 95 percent of the farside, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the farside coverage and acquired up to two-meter resolution images of 36 pre-selected areas."

Instead of sending television pictures back to Earth as electrical signals, Lunar Orbiter took actual photographs, developed them on board, and then scanned them using a special photoelectric system. For this reason scientists referred to Lunar Orbiter as the \"flying drugstore.\" Due to the possibility that radiation in space would fog photographic film, a slow speed film was used. This required the spacecraft to move slightly whenever its shutters were opened to prevent blurring. The resulting images had exceptional quality and provided resolutions of up to 3 feet from an altitude of 30 nautical miles."

This special attachment featured a suction cup on the back side to allow Glenn to easily place the device against the visor when he was required to keep it down. The viewfinder was removeable for when Glenn did not need his visor down, and the velcro strip on the rounded top let him manage its location inside the spacecraft."

It includes the silver and black retrorocket package used to slow the capsule for return to Earth and the nose section containing the parachutes. The first American in space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr., hoped to fly this Mercury capsule on a long-duration orbital mission in late 1963 called Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10). After the success of MA-9, flown by astronaut Gordon Cooper in May 1963, NASA decided to cancel MA-10 to concentrate on its next human spaceflight project, Gemini. Reflecting Shepard's hope of flying in space again, he had the name Freedom 7 II, in tribute to his historic 1961 capsule, Freedom 7, painted on the spacecraft."

The astronauts would release an inflatable paraglider wing based on the work of Francis Rogallo, and maneuver to a runway or dry lake bed. Astronauts \"Gus\" Grissom and Neil Armstrong were among those who piloted the Paresev during several hundred flights at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Paresev was towed by a ground vehicle or a small aircraft and released at an altitude between 5,000 and 12,000 feet. It was tested with three different wings; the 1-A is the first configuration. Before the paraglider concept could be fully developed for the Gemini program, NASA decided to stick with the proven technology of parachutes and water landing."

They converted the gun bays forward of the pilot to accommodate the observer, cutting a 20-inch hole in the upper skin and mounting a seat, small windscreen, and instrument panel in this rather cramped, open cavity. Flight tests resumed on October 30, 1942, and for the remainder of its AAF career, the aircraft flew in that configuration."

The airplane had amassed only 59 hours and 55 minutes of flying time. On April 18, 1945, the Smithsonian asked for the aircraft. Before opening the new National Air and Space Museum in 1976, the staff restored the plane to its original configuration and removed the observer's open cockpit. Befitting its history, the first Airacomet now hangs in the Milestones of Flight gallery."

Bush complied the following month and the \"Special Committee on Jet Propulsion\" included representatives from the Army Air Corps, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, National Bureau of Standards, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the three U. S. manufacturers of various industrial turbines and turbo-superchargers for reciprocating aircraft engines, Allis Chalmers, Westinghouse, and General Electric."

A W.1X turbojet engine designed by Frank Whittle powered the E.28/39. Arnold returned to the U. S. in May and briefed members of the AAF Engineering Division at Wright Field, Ohio, and the U. S. State Department. Efforts began to exchange information on this technology and on July 22, 1941, British and American officials met to discuss it. On September 4, officials of the U. S. government, the Army Air Forces, and the General Electric company met and decided that the United States must begin at once to construct 15 jet turbine aircraft engines (copies of a new Whittle engine, the W.2B) and three jet airplanes. The Whittle engine was not overly powerful so the group chose a twin-engine configuration for the new jet. General Electric was selected to build the engines because the firm was already familiar with the Gloster aircraft and the Whittle engine. Several factors influenced the group's decision to select the Bell Aircraft Corporation to build the new fighter."

Their location near the General Electric plant was thought a boon to the vital exchange of information between airframe and engine developers. The group also considered Larry Bell's enthusiasm and reputation for making unorthodox designs fly. On September 5, Arnold informed Bell that his company would undertake the new project. A contract was awarded on September 30. AAF leaders and Bell officials chose the designation XP-59A as a good cover for the true nature of this work because the designation originally referred to a piston engine fighter project proposed earlier by Bell. General Electric used a similar ruse. At that time, the company built aircraft engine superchargers with model designations 'A' through 'F.' 'I' seemed to fit this pattern. 'A' signified the first of a series so General Electric and the AAF designated the first American jet airplane engine the Type I-A."

The team was guided only by theory. General Electric would not finish and begin testing the first engine until March 1942 so Bell could only guess at the performance characteristics. In fact, neither the W.1X engine shipped from England in October 1941 nor General Electric's own versions could generate the power levels initially predicted. Extreme secrecy and great urgency also hampered the project. For security reasons and to get the airplane flying as quickly as possible, General Arnold had at first forbidden use of wind tunnels to test and optimize the design. Later he relented but only allowed the group to use the low-speed tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio."

To maintain secrecy, Bell mounted a dummy propeller on the nose and threw a tarpaulin over the fuselage to disguise the Airacomet as just another new piston engine aircraft. Mechanics removed the \"propeller\" before flight and reinstalled it after the airplane landed. On October 1, 1942, Bell test pilot Robert M. Stanley took the XP-59A into the air for the first time. During this initial flight, Stanley kept the landing gear fully extended and flew no higher than 7.6 m (25 ft). Later that day, he made three more flights and reached heights of 30 m (100 ft). The flight envelope expanded further the next day after four more flights at altitudes as high as 3,048 m (10,000 ft)."

More powerful General Electric I-16 (J31) turbojet engines powered these and all subsequent production Airacomets. The first of 13 YP-59As arrived for flight-testing at Muroc in June 1943. One of these aircraft set a new unofficial altitude record of 14,512 m (47,600 ft). Although Bell proposed that the Army Air Forces should acquire 300 P-59 production fighter aircraft, the Army decided to order only 100. Despite the altitude record, the P-59 was clearly outclassed by contemporary piston engine fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and Lockheed P-38 Lightning (see NASM collection for these aircraft)."

Each was armed with one 37-mm M-4 cannon and 44 rounds of ammunition, and three .50 cal. machine guns and 200 rounds per gun. The P-59Bs were assigned to the 412th Fighter Group to familiarize AAF pilots with the handling and performance characteristics of jet aircraft. The P-59 aircraft could fly at a maximum speed of 658 kph (409 mph) at 10,640 m (35,000 ft)."

Shortly the jet's first flight, the Army recognized the need to have an observer on board to record flight test data. They converted the gun bays forward of the pilot to accommodate the observer, cutting a 20-inch hole in the upper skin and mounting a seat, small windscreen, and instrument panel in this rather cramped, open cavity! Flight tests resumed on October 30, 1942, and for the remainder of its AAF career, the aircraft flew in that configuration."

                "content": "In February 1944, an AAF engineer assigned to the Airacomet project originated the idea of saving America's first jet aircraft for museum display. In August, the Army notified Bell that they planned to store the airframe at Muroc and the original engines at Wright Field, Ohio, until they could determine final disposition. The airplane had amassed only 59 hours and 55 minutes of flying time. On April 18, 1945, the Smithsonian asked for the aircraft. Before opening the new National Air and Space Museum in 1976, the staff restored the plane to its original configuration and removed the observer's open cockpit. Befitting its history, the first Airacomet now hangs in the Milestones of Flight gallery."

Equally important was the lower cost, as compared to the French Clerget, then widely used in British aircraft; and itself considered an improvement over the earlier Gnome"

Using the resulting Hyper No. 1 cylinder, the Air Corps instructed Continental in 1934 to develop what became the horizontally opposed O-1430 to be buried in the wings of large aircraft to improve streamlining for higher speed. However, by this time, the Air Corps decided that 746 kW (1,000 hp) engines were obsolete for bombers, and that fighter wings were too thin for a submerged installation."

Following development problems, it was decided in 1943 that the engine could not possibly be used in the war, and only eight engines were built for experimental use. This Continental I-1430-11 was test flown in a modified Lockheed P-38 testbed aircraft."

The wings were mounted low on the fuselage and incorporated high-speed and low-speed ailerons as well as a sophisticated flap and spoiler system. Four Pratt & Whitney JT3 turbojet engines, each producing 10,000 pounds of thrust, were mounted on struts beneath the wings."

During the festivities surrounding this event, Boeing had gathered many airline representatives to enjoy the competition and witness a fly past of the new Dash 80. To the audience's intense delight and Boeing's profound shock, test pilot Alvin \"Tex\" Johnston barrel-rolled the Dash 80 over the lake in full view of thousands of astonished spectators. Johnston vividly displayed the superior strength and performance of this new jet, readily convincing the airline industry to buy this new airliner."

Trippe had been spending much of his time searching for a suitable jet airliner to enable his pioneering company to maintain its leadership in international air travel. Working with Boeing, Trippe overcame Boeing's resistance to widening the Dash-80 design, now known as the 707, to seat six passengers in each seat row rather than five. Trippe did so by placing an order with Boeing for 20 707s but also ordering 25 of Douglas's competing DC-8, which had yet to fly but could accommodate six-abreast seating. At Pan Am's insistence, the 707 was made four inches wider than the Dash 80 so that it could carry 160 passengers six-abreast. The wider fuselage developed for the 707 became the standard design for all of Boeing's subsequent narrow-body airliners."

In October 1958 Pan American ushered the jet age into the United States when it opened international service with the Boeing 707 in October 1958. National Airlines inaugurated domestic jet service two months later using a 707-120 borrowed from Pan Am. American Airlines flew the first domestic 707 jet service with its own aircraft in January 1959. American set a new speed mark when it opened the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental jet service in 1959. Subsequent nonstop flights between New York and San Francisco took only 5 hours - 3 hours less than by the piston-engine DC-7. The one-way fare, including a $10 surcharge for jet service, was $115.50, or $231 round trip. The flight was almost 40 percent faster and almost 25 percent cheaper than flying by piston-engine airliners. The consequent surge of traffic demand was substantial."

The Air Corps ordered an engineering prototype in March 1932, and after initial testing by Allison, it was delivered for experimental tests to the Air Corps at Wright Field in July 1933, with the first production engine delivered in February 1935.

During World War II, V-1710s powered various models of the Lockheed P-38, Curtiss P-40, Bell P-39 and P-63, and North American P-51 fighter aircraft. Constant development, including use of a turbocharger, increased the rated take-off power to as high as 1,715 kW (2,300 hp) following World War II."

The H-i was powered by a Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial piston engine, which was rated at 700 horsepower at 8,500 feet but which could deliver 1,000 horsepower for high-speed flight. A wind tunnel model of the aircraft was exhaustively tested in the 200-mph wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory.

On the base is inscribed the date October 4, 1957 (the launch of Sputnik), and the letters CCCP (Cyrillic letters for USSR). When wound, the music box plays a short tune, followed by beeps that represent the characteristic beeps of the satellite that could be heard by amateur radio operators throughout the world during the last three months of 1957. This object was added to the national collection for its significance to the cultural and psychological impact of the Sputnik launch. Although the satellite itself was a very simple one, carrying only basic instruments for measuring temperature and pressure, and a radio transmitter, its impact on world politics, military affairs, and science and technology was profound. The launch of Sputnik transported the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union to a new arena and began the Space Race."

Spad was taken over in 1914 by the famous aviation pioneer, Louis Bl\u00e9riot, when the firm was experiencing serious financial difficulties.

In 1915, he recognized the design limits of the then popular air-cooled, rotary engines that powered most French aircraft. A fixed, water-cooled engine, capable of generating at least 150 horsepower, was in his view the power plant of the future. At this time, just such an engine was undergoing trials. It was a new Hispano-Suiza V-8, designed by that company's founder and chief designer, a Swiss-born engineer named Marc Birkigt. The engine was a great step forward in that it had a much better power-to-weight ratio than previous water-cooled designs, as well as many other modern features. The new Hispano-Suiza engine was just what B\u00e9chereau was calling for. He designed his next airframe around the advanced Hispano-Suiza motor; the result was the famous Spad VII. By the fall of 1916, Spad VIIs were entering French squadrons and were well received. More than five-and-a-half thousand Spad VIIs were built."

The prototype Spad XIII made its first flight on April 4, 1917, and by the end of the following month, production aircraft were arriving at the front.

So long as I stayed up, the balloon would be full, but once 1 started down the gas would begin to contract under the increasing air pressure, so that if I could keep all the gas I had, there still would be less than 10,000 cubic feet when I reached the ground. \""

Keeping one eye on the statoscope, which indicated his rate of fall, Gray knew he was in trouble, and increased his attempts to lighten the load by parachuting equipment."

The aircraft pilots, who had had little difficulty maintaining contact with the balloon on previous occasions, now lost sight of Gray when he flew into a cloud bank over McLeansboro, Illinois. The aircraft continued south, hoping to spot the balloon again, but were finally forced to scatter and land at Henderson and Madisonville, Kentucky, late that afternoon. Gray, they knew, had to be on the ground by this time, probably someplace farther south. At the time, however, they could only hope for the best and wait for Gray to send word of his location."

On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Baker and Able (a female rhesus monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The cradle was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960."

After Walter Beech's death in 1950, his wife and co-founder, Olive Ann, became president and chairman of Beech, and she continued the profitable aircraft production lines while also diversifying into other aerospace endeavors. In 1959, Beech Aircraft introduced the Model 65 Queen Air to fill the gap between the six-seat twin-Bonanza, a derivative of the single-engine Bonanza introduced in 1947, and the Super 18, a deluxe version of the classic Beech 18. The Queen Air featured the low-wing, all-metal, tricycle design typical of Beech's post-war aircraft, carried seven to nine passengers, and featured two horizontally-opposed 340-hp Lycoming engines. Subsequent improvements included a swept tail and a pressurized fuselage, but when turboprop engines were added to a Queen Air 88 in 1964, it was re-designated the King Air 90."

The first King Air, powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-6 engines, flew on January 20, 1964 and, after the prototype completed a 230-hour test program, the design received its type certificate on May 27, 1964. The first production aircraft deliveries began in late 1964."

                "content": "The design was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of aluminum construction with retractable tricycle landing gear. To improve its utility and safety in changing flight conditions, standard equipment, that had been optional on the Queen Air, included de-icing boots on the leading edges of the wings, fin, and tailplane. Flight instruments allowed for all-weather capabilities and various communications and navigation packages included autopilot, radio, and radar systems. The Model 90 had two seats in the cockpit and four reclining passenger seats facing each other in the cabin, with options for a two or three-place couch for passengers. Air conditioning and soundproofing also improved passenger comfort in the cabin. Two 500-hp P&W Canada PT6A-6 turboprop engines with three-blade Hartzell propellers gave the King Air a top ceiling of 27,400 feet and a range of 1,565 miles at 270 mph. Piston-powered aircraft could not match this performance while emerging jet aircraft of the 1960s used turbojet engines that were high-priced, noisy, and had high fuel consumption."

                "content": "Rather than investing in a completely new and expensive technology, Beech built a vastly improved and marketable business aircraft from its existing production line. After the King Air's initial success, Beech concentrated on continuous upgrades to appeal to a range of executive and corporate needs. Sophisticated electronics packages, increased cabin space, and finer interior amenities in Models 90, 100, 200, 300, and 350 provided comfortable working and transport environments for business travelers. Newer models are longer and sport T-tails, but the basic configuration remains the same and continues to appeal as a new or previously owned medium-range aircraft. In addition to the airframe, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine family consistently provides a high level of performance and reliability. Nearly 40 years since its introduction, the King Air series is still the king of the turboprops and fills a significant niche in the business aviation marketplace."

One hundred and twelve of these models were built. The aircraft received its airworthiness certificate on April 16, 1965 and was registered as N1920H. The exterior was white with Morning Glory Blue and Jubilee Gold trim and the interior was Frontier Green, Black and Arctic Beige. On April 23, 1965, the Aviation Department of Helmerich and Payne, Inc., of Tulsa, Oklahoma, purchased the aircraft and the company flew the aircraft almost every other day for many years, mostly around the Central Plains states. The aircraft's registration changed to N10LE on October 8, 1973 and it flew in California, until May 20, 1976, when the registration was changed to N275DP. I FLY SOUTH of Wilmington, Delaware, owned the aircraft by 1994 and it then returned to Raytheon's Beech Aircraft Corporation in March 1998. Stevens Aviation, of Vandalia, Ohio, performed general maintenance and painted it white with red and gray trim before Raytheon flew it to National Airport near Washington, DC, in April 1998. There, its flight career ended with 7,164.5 hours on the airframe. It was disassembled and trucked across the Potomac River to the Museum for installation in the Business Wings exhibit. In July of 2000, when the exhibit closed, Raytheon donated the aircraft to the Museum."

Its purpose was to prevent the unlikely spread of lunar contagions by isolating the astronauts from contact with other people. A converted Airstream trailer, the MQF contained living and sleeping quarters, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Quarantine was assured by keeping the air pressure inside lower than the pressure outside and by filtering the air vented from the facility."

They, together with a physician and a technician, remained in it for 88 hours while the MQF was transported on the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii and from there to nearby Hickam AFB. At Hickam, the MQF was loaded into the cargo hold of a C-141 aircraft and flown to Ellington AFB in Houston, Texas. The MQF, with the astronauts still on board, was then transported to the NASA Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Johnson Space Center where there were more spacious quarantine facilities. The astronauts were allowed to emerge from quarantine once scientists were sure they were not infected with \"moon germs.\""

In addition to a generous acceptance within the aviation world, where it is regarded as the Cadillac of the single-engine light-plane field, the Bonanza also rated high marks in the industrial design field. In a survey of 100 leading designers, design teachers, and architects, published in Fortune magazine, April 1959, the Bonanza was rated as one of the 100 best designs of mass-produced products."

In 1951, Congressman Peter Mack renamed the aircraft the Friendship Flame and made an around the world goodwill flight."

Severe weather over Nevada forced Odom to abandon his ultimate goal of flying the entire continent and return to Oakland 22 hours and 6 minutes after takeoff."

Leaving Springfield, Illinois, on October 7, 1951, the plane, rechristened Friendship Flame, visited forty-five major cities in thirty-five countries. Concerned with rising hotspots and international tensions, Mack met with ordinary citizens and dignitaries on his self-directed and self-funded global dialogue and peace mission. It provided a snapshot of a post-World War II and nuclear age world and made international headlines. Mack held talks with leaders of Middle East countries on the verge of dramatic change and stopped in Korea despite the ongoing war but was denied permission to enter the Soviet Union. Mack flew over mountains, deserts, and water in all kinds of weather and became the first person to solo the Pacific Ocean. On April 19, 1952, 113 days and 33,000 miles later, the plane returned to Wichita, Kansas."

The Bonanza is regarded as a classic aircraft design of the post-World War II era and is easily identified by its distinctive V-tail. Though a number of other design refinements contributed to the efficiency of this airplane, the \"butterfly tail\" is the most distinguishing outward characteristic. This unique feature was tested during the waning years of World War II and found promising. The most important advantages of this design were the reduction in the number of parts and in weight. Control response with the V-tail is equivalent to conventional tail surfaces of 40 percent greater area."

The others were destroyed in training accidents or by Allied bombing attacks. The almost absolute Allied dominance of the air, and the development of fighter sweep tactics that offset the Me 262's performance advantage, ensured that the revolutionary fighter did not affect Allied air operations."

It went through a long gestation period, not making its first flight until April 18, 1941, and then only under the power of a Junkers Jumo 210G piston engine of about 700 horsepower. Jet engine development, although more advanced in Germany than elsewhere, was still in a primitive state, and the turbine engines intended for the sleek fighter were not ready. On July 19, 1942, Flugkapit\u00e4n Fritz Wendel made the first takeoff under jet power, and from that point on the Me 262 became a ray of hope in the increasingly dark skies of the German Luftwaffe."

Hitler's order did divert some 30 percent of production airframes to the Me 262A-2a Sturmvogel (Stormbird) bomber type."

The airfields from which it flew were under constant attack, and in the last days of the war, the remaining Me 262 units were forced to operate from makeshift bases constructed along Germany's famous autobahns. Although 1,443 Me 262s were completed, it is estimated that only about 300 saw combat. The airplane was reportedly delightful to fly, as long as the pilot used care in moving the throttles to avoid an engine compressor stall."

Glenn's flight was the third manned mission of Project Mercury, following two suborbital flights by astronauts in 1961. Glenn's three-orbit mission on February 20, 1962, was a sterling success, as he overcame problems with the automatic control system that would have ended an unmanned flight. But reentry was tense, as a faulty telemetry signal from the spacecraft indicated that the heat shield might be loose. Mission Control instructed Glenn not to jettison the retrorocket package after firing in order to better hold the heat shield in place. Glenn reentered successfully and splashed down in the Atlantic 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds after launch."

(The X-1 E is currently on exhibit outside the NASA Flight Research Center, Edwards, California.) The X-1 #3 (46-064) had a turbopump-driven, low-pressure fuel feed system. This aircraft, known popularly as the X-1-3 Queenie, was lost in a 1951 explosion on the ground that injured its pilot. Three additional X-1 aircraft, the X-1A, X-1B, and X-1D, were constructed and test-flown. Two of these. the X-1A and X-1D, were also lost, as a result of propulsion system explosions."

Nevertheless, on January 5,1949, the X-1 #1 Glamorous Glennis successfully completed a ground takeoff from Muroc Dry Lake, piloted by Chuck Yeager. The maximum speed attained by the X-1 #1 was Mach 1.45 at 40,130 feet, approximately 957 mph, during a flight by Yeager on March 26, 1948. On August 8,1949, Maj. Frank K. Everest, Jr., USAF, reached an altitude of 71,902 feet, the highest flight made by the little rocket airplane. It continued flight test operations until mid-1950, by which time it had completed a total of nineteen contractor demonstration flights and fifty-nine Air Force test flights."

The gyroscopic effects of its powerful rotary engine made it dangerous for novice pilots, and almost as many were killed in accidents as died in combat. But its instability also contributed to it being agile and maneuverable, and once its tricky characteristics were mastered, the Camel was a superior fighting airplane."

On May 20-21, 1932, Earhart became the first woman, and the second person after Charles Lindbergh, to fly nonstop and solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Flying a red Lockheed Vega 5B, she left Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, Canada, and landed about 15 hours later near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The feat made Earhart an instant worldwide sensation and proved she was a courageous and able pilot. Then, on August 24-25, she made the first solo, nonstop flight by a woman across the United States, from Los Angeles to Newark, New Jersey, establishing a women's record of 19 hours and 5 minutes and setting a women's distance record of 2,447 miles."

She attended her first flying exhibition in 1918 while serving as a Red Cross nurse's aide in Toronto, Canada. She took her first flight in California in December 1920, with veteran flyer Frank Hawks, and declared, \"As soon as I left the ground, I knew I myself had to fly.\" Her first instructor was Anita \"Neta\" Snook who gave her lessons in a Curtiss Jenny. To pay for flight lessons, Earhart worked as a telephone company clerk and photographer. Earhart soloed in 1921, bought her first airplane, a Kinner Airster, in 1922 and wasted no time in setting a women's altitude record of 14,000 feet. In 1923, Earhart became the 16th woman to receive an official F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale pilot license."

During her 2,026-mile nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic on May 20-21, 1932, Earhart fought fatigue, a leaky fuel tank, and a cracked manifold that spewed flames out the side of the engine cowling. Ice formed on the Vega's wings and caused an unstoppable 3,000-foot descent to just above the waves. Realizing she was on a course far north of France, she landed in a farmer's field in Culmore, near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Acclaimed in London, Paris, and Rome, she returned home to a ticker tape parade in New York City and honors in Washington, D.C. By July and August she was back in the Vega for her transcontinental flight."

Of that flight she remarked: \"I wanted the flight just to contribute. I could only hope one more passage across that part of the Pacific would mark a little more clearly the pathway over which an air service of the future will inevitably ply.\" Later that year, Earhart made record flights from Los Angeles to Mexico City and from Mexico City to Newark, New Jersey.

Many companies contributed their latest aviation technology to her Flying Laboratory."

                "content": "Earhart decided to make a world flight and she planned a route as close to the equator as possible, which meant flying several long overwater legs to islands in the Pacific Ocean. On March 20, 1937, Earhart crashed on takeoff at Luke Field, Honolulu, Hawaii, ending her westbound world flight that had begun at Oakland, California. The Electra was returned to Lockheed Aircraft Company in Burbank, California, for extensive repairs. On June 1, 1937, Earhart began an eastbound around-the-world flight from Oakland, via Miami, Florida, in the Electra with Fred Noonan as her navigator. They reached Lae, New Guinea on June 29, having flown 22,000 miles with 7,000 more to go to Oakland. They then departed Lae on July 2 for the 2,556-mile flight to their next refueling stop, Howland Island, a two-mile long and less-than-a-mile wide dot in the Pacific Ocean."

However, the Itasca did receive several strong voice transmissions from Earhart as she approached the area, the last at 8:43 am stating: \"We are on the line of position 156-137. Will repeat message. We will repeat this message on 6210 kilocycles. Wait. Listening on 6210 kilocycles. We are running north and south.\" Earhart and Noonan never found Howland and they were declared lost at sea on July 19, 1937 following a massive sea and air search."

The most reasonable explanation, based on the known facts of her flight, is that they were unable to locate Howland Island, ran out of fuel, and ditched into the Pacific Ocean."

Development work began in 1908, making it one of the earliest companies to produce radial power plants. Except for being water-cooled, the Salmson engines demonstrated the advantages of the radial concept, being the first successful large aircraft engines of this type."

Kirkham of Savona, N.Y., one of the earliest and best known airplane engine designers and builders, originally built motorcycle engines, and did casting and machining for Glenn Curtiss, whose Hammondsport factory was nearby. Between 1910 and 1912, Kirkham designed and built his own engines. From 1915 to 1919, he was Chief Engineer for the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Corporation; later founding his own company."

This Command Module, no. 107, manufactured by North American Rockwell, was one of three parts of the complete Apollo spacecraft. The other two parts were the Service Module and the Lunar Module, nicknamed \"Eagle.\" The Service Module contained the main spacecraft propulsion system and consumables while the Lunar Module was the two-person craft used by Armstrong and Aldrin to descend to the Moon's surface on July 20. The Command Module is the only portion of the spacecraft to return to Earth."

Aeronca bought production rights to a small and light airplane designed solely for recreational flying by French-born Jean A. Roch\u00e9, Senior Aeronautical Engineer for the U.S. Army Air Service. The airplane, engineered for production by Roger E. Schlemmer of the University of Cincinnati's Aeronautical School, was designated the C-2 (Roch\u00e9's hand-built plane being considered the first of the type). Work began on the production prototype in 1929 and it first flew on October 20, 1929. Painted bright yellow and orange, it was assigned registration NX626N."

There was almost no private ownership during the decade following World War I for the open-cockpit biplanes had to work to earn their keep. Even the barnstormer's Jenny-despite inexpensive price and romantic images-was strictly a commercial venture that bore little resemblance to the luxury of owning an automobile. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, aircraft manufacturers began to cater to the lucrative but limited market of the wealthy sportsman pilot. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris in the Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis heightened public awareness of the airplane, but, ironically, it was the depression that further promoted the emergence of light airplanes by making larger aircraft too expensive to operate. These factors, and advances in airframe and engine technology, set the stage for one of the most significant trends in aviation between the wars when it became possible for a significant segment of American society to own and fly an airplane."

                "content": "The first C-2s that Aeronca demonstrated at aviation expositions around the country won enthusiastic acceptance during the latter half of 1930. Squat and bug-eyed, the diminutive Aeronca C-2 was a simple airplane with modest performance and delightful flying characteristics. Its steel-tube fuselage and wooden wings were covered with fabric and braced with wires. The pilot, seated before a stick and rudder bar, had just four instruments: oil temperature, oil pressure, nonsensitive altimeter, and tachometer. The single-seat C-2 was powered by a two-cylinder Aeronca E-107 engine rated at 26-30 hp. In 1929, the Aeronca C-2 sold for $1,495. By mid-1930, the price had dropped to $1,245 as a result of the depression. C-2s were economical at 1 cent a mile for oil and gas, and they could often be rented for just $4.00 an hour. Furthermore, they were simple to fly, easy to maintain, and had no bad characteristics to spring on a novice pilot. By 1931, more than 100 C-2s had been sold and Aeronca introduced the two-seat C-3, with an Aeronca E-1 13 36-40 hp engine. With seating for two side-by-side, the C-3 offered greater utility than the C-2 and quickly became popular as a trainer. \"Airknockers\" or \"Flying Bathtubs, as they were affectionately known, made it possible for the average person to fly. Other light aircraft began to appear but the Aeronca style remained popular and C-3 production ended in 1937 with more than 500 produced built."

In 1948, after the establishment of the National Air Museum in 1946, the Aeronca Company answered a call by the Smithsonian Institution to various companies and organizations for historic aircraft and donated the first Aeronca, C-2 NX626N. The C-2 was restored 1976 and was briefly displayed in the General Aviation gallery."

The Germans claimed that a pilot flew a Do 335 at a speed of 846 km/h (474 mph) in level flight at a time when the official world speed record was 755 km/h (469 mph). Two liquid-cooled engines each developing about 1,750 hp powered the Do 335. Dornier mounted one engine in the nose and the other in the tail in a unique low-drag push-pull configuration. This innovative design also featured an ejection seat, a tail fin which the pilot could jettison, and tricycle landing gear. For a fighter airplane, the Do 335 was enormous: tall enough that a person of normal height could walk beneath it and very heavy at 9,600 kg (21,000 lb) loaded. Serious flaws also plagued the design. The rear engine overheated often and the landing gear was weak and prone to failure."

The RLM (German Aviation Ministry) wanted to support development of push-pull aircraft but initially only as seaplanes and bombers. By 1942, the Luftwaffe needed multi-role fighters and after submitting a proposal in January 1943 for a Schnellbomber (fast bomber), Dornier built a prototype Do 335 V-1 (\u2018V\u2019 for Versuchs or experimental) and the aircraft completed its first flight in September 1943. Following initial testing, the RLM ordered 14 prototypes, ten preproduction aircraft with the suffix designation A-0, eleven production A-1 single-seat aircraft, and 3 A-10 and A-12 two-seat trainers."

                "content": "Dornier selected two Daimler-Benz DB-603 V-12 cylinder engines to propel the four different versions of the Do 335. Each engine displaced 44.5 liters (2,670 cu in) and weighed 910 kg (2,006 lb). Unlike conventional twin-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines, the Do 335 would not yaw sharply to one side if one engine failed, and single-engine flying speed remained respectable at about 620 km/h (345 mph). Pilots reported exceptional flight performance in acceleration and turning radius, and docile handling with no dangerous spin characteristics. In an emergency, however, the pilot could detonate explosive bolts and jettison the pusher three-blade propeller and dorsal fin to increase the chances of successfully bailing out using the pneumatic ejection seat. When fired, the seat pushed the pilot away from the aircraft with a force of about 20 Gs."

One of many plans issued by the RLM called for Dornier to build 310 Do 335s by late 1945. Although combat conversion units received several pre-production aircraft about 10 months before the war ended, no pilots flew Do 335s in combat. Only one example of the first production version Do 335A-1 rolled off the Dornier assembly line at Friedrichshafen just before the war ended. One 30 mm MK-103 cannon (70 rounds were carried) firing through the propeller hub and two 15 mm MG-151/15 cannon (200 rounds per gun) firing from the top cowling of the forward engine armed this model, and an internal bomb load of 500 kg (1,100 lb) could be carried."

Crafts persons completed the aircraft at Dornier's plant at Mengen, Germany, on 30 September 1944, and then test-flew the airplane during the winter of 1944-45. From 20-23 April 1945, German test pilot Hans Werner Lerche flew the Do 335 from Rechlin back to Oberpfaffenhofen near M\u00fcnich, via Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Lechfeld, Germany. Allied forces found the Do 335 at Oberpfaffenhofen on April 29."

Following testing from 1945-48, the U. S. Navy transferred the Do 335 to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum in 1961. The Do 335 remained stored at Naval Air Station Norfolk until 1974 when the Smithsonian returned it to Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, where the Dornier company preserved and restored the airplane in 1975. Dornier crafts persons, many of them factory employees since World War II, were surprised to find still attached to the aircraft the explosive bolts designed to blow off the tail fin and rear propeller. Dornier displayed the preserved airplane at the May 1976 Hannover Airshow, and then moved the artifact to the Deutsches Museum in Munich until the aircraft was returned to the Paul E. Garber Facility for storage in 1986."

In 1968-1970 the Convair Division of General Dynamics evaluated the aerodynamics of both a delta wing and a straight wing spacecraft design with either a vertical or a horizontal tail. This model, which can be reconfigured with different wings, tails, and fuselage sections, is a versatile device for testing design concepts. It suggests the experimentation and craft of aeronautical engineering. The model set passed from General Dynamics to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and then to a private collector who donated it to the Museum in 2007."

Mounted on top of the rear of the fuselage is the pulsejet tube with recessed intake circular grill in front and open exhaust exit at the rear. The front of the tube has a larger diameter to accommodate the grill, internal flappers, and combustion chamber with fuel injectors and spark plug, while the rear gradually tapers down to the straight, elongated exhaust. At the front of the missile's aluminum alloy nose fairing is a small propeller for determining range. Inside the missile, behind the wings, are two wire-wound compressed air spheres for the pneumatic control servos. During restoration, the Smithsonian's specimen was found to have these spheres and German inscriptions that confirm that the V-1 in NASM is German, not an American copy known as the JB-2 or Loon. However, the color scheme, borrowed from a V-1 displayed in a British museum, is not authentic, the yellow nose in particular being inaccurate. The operational colors were usually a camouflage pattern of greens and light blue. Moreover, this artifact also lacks the air-log propeller."

Pneumatic signals from the gyros created pressure differentials that were converted to mechanical forces, opening valves for high-pressure compressed air that moved the pistons in the actuators for the rudder and elevators. Roll control was done through the rudder, as there were no ailerons on the wings. Altitude was controlled by an aneroid pre-set in millibars of atmospheric pressure. Maximum altitude was about 10,000 ft, but most bombs flew at only a few thousand feet. When the propeller made a set number of revolutions, a counter fired a detonator in the tail that locked the elevator in a neutral position, cut off rudder control and deployed two hinged spoilers from the underside of the tailplane, causing the missile to a dive on its target."

The V-1 was normally launched from a firing tube mounted on an inclined metal ramp 150 feet long by 16 feet high. Pressurized hydrogen peroxide caused a piston on the ramp to thrust forward, hurling the missile into the air where the pulsejet would be activated once the missile had attained an initial operational speed of 200-mph. During early test flights, before the development of the catapult, solid-fuel rocket boosters were used. The V-1 was also air-launched by modified Heinkel He 111 aircraft. The usual flight time for the V-1, which used low grade aviation gasoline, was about half an hour at altitudes of between two and three thousand feet and speeds of up to 400 mph. The British and Americans called the missile the Buzz Bomb because of the buzzing noise of its air-breathing pulsejet engine, and also the Flying Bomb, Doodle Bug, and Robot Bomb."

Among these was the \"reactor pulse\" concept of the Russian Victor de Karavodine who applied for a French patent on 9 April 1906, which was granted as No. 374,124 on 10 April 1907. His idea was a kind of pulsejet with a low pressure supercharger and sparkplug igniter. The Belgian inventor Georges Marconet applied for a Belgian patent in 1909 for a similar idea meant to be applied to aircraft and was granted French patent No. 412,478. The Frenchmen Barbazat, Lenoir, and Ren\u00e9 Lorin evolved ideas along these lines. Lorin's concepts, published in the magazine L'Aerophile in 1913 and later in his L'Air et la Vitesse (Air and Speed) (Paris, 1919), were well publicized. Lorin, who claimed his work went back to 1907, advocated the development of long-range missiles for bombarding objectives like Berlin. His designs consisted of both ram and pulsejet type devices."

He conducted experiments at the Munich-Wiesenfeld airfield under support from the Research Division of the Ministry of Transportation. Schmidt was primarily interested in pulsejets for aircraft. He constructed a motor with a duct which produced a thrust of 450 kg (1,000 lbs.) but it was destroyed after only 13 minutes of operation. Nonetheless, the inventor continued to receive support from the Transportation Ministry to 1935 and then from this organization's successor, the RLM or Air Ministry, although the work proceeded slowly. From 1935 to 1940, the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) provided additional funds, with which Schmidt established a full-time research group at Munich, with Hans Lembcke as his chief assistant. By 1941, Schmidt produced his SR 500 model; by the following year it generated 1,650 lbs. of thrust, but there were difficulties with its noise level and inefficient fuel spray arrangement."

At first unaware of Schmidt's work, he meanwhile began the design of a similar motor. The Argus motor used a flow valve but the group soon learned of Schmidt's developments and through his cooperation in February 1940, they adopted his superior flap valves, but otherwise the Argus company pursued its own arrangement. There was no further cooperation between Schmidt and Argus, although by 1943 the V-1 pulsejet was called the Argus-Schmidtrohr, or Argus-Schmidt tube. The first successful Argus pulsejet produced a thrust of 300 kg (660 lbs.) and was sufficiently reliable. With modifications, including a fuel regulator, the thrust was increased to 350 kg (770 lbs.). Beginning in April 1941, flight tests were made on cargo gliders and other aircraft with an eye to using the pulsejet as aircraft propulsion, but ultimately the severe vibration it produced made it unusable for that purpose."

All earlier missiles had used reciprocating engines, although missiles using various forms of reaction propulsion had been discussed in Germany since at least 1934. In early 1942, Gosslau proposed to designer Dr. Robert Lusser, who had left Heinkel aircraft and was looking for a job, that they work together on a pulsejet flying bomb, and although Lusser ultimately decided to go to Fieseler Flugzeugbau (Fiesler Aircraft Construction Company) of Kassel, this collaboration came to fruition soon thereafter as an Argus-Fieseler project. V-1 development was accelerated by the British bombing of the old medieval Hanseatic city of L\u00fcbeck, which incensed Hitler; on 14 April 1942 he ordered retaliatory \"terror attacks\" against British cities other than London. Two weeks later Argus and Fieseler presented a proposal for a project Erfurt P35, which closely resembled the latter Fi 103 or V-1."

To insure secrecy, the missile was first designated the Kirschkern and then FZG 76, which signified a target or target-towing craft for anti-aircraft gunners. An additional reason for the high priority on the flying bomb was rivalry with the Army, which just at this time began test launches of its revolutionary, rocket-powered A-4 ballistic missile-the later V-2."

On 10 December the first Fi 103 flight test was made-an air launch from the Fw 200. The first ground-launch test, using a concrete ramp, was made at Peenem\u00fcnde-West on 24 December in which the missile flew for sixty seconds. In later tests, ranges of 150 miles was achieved with accuracies of a half a mile, but this came only after a long and difficult series of flight tests in which a number of technical problems with the pulsejet and the Askania guidance system manifested themselves."

Up to this time, about 9,000 V-1's, including more than 2,000 abortive missiles or misses, were fired against England. The V-1 campaign against Antwerp and other Belgian cities continued from launch sites in Germany and the Netherlands. The first air-launch of a V-1 took place on 9 July 1944, when Heinkel He 111s of III./KG 3 began attacking London. After the V-1 sites in the Pas de Calais were overrun by Allied troops at the end of August 1944, for many months the only way to attack Britain with V-1 was by air. Due to fuel shortages, exhaustion and combat losses from exploding V-1 and Allied fighters, KG 53's campaign finally ended on 14 January 1945."

This aircraft, as the first of its type in the United States, generated considerable interest in commercial and governmental circles. It validated Pitcairn's interest in the new category of aircraft and inspired other American pioneers to enter the field. The C.8W deserves recognition as the progenitor of the American gyroplane and as the first successful rotary-wing aircraft to fly in the United States."

                "content": "The word \"Autogiro\" is a proprietary name coined by Juan de la Cierva. His designs were the first aircraft to fall in the gyroplane category. Nonetheless, nearly all gyroplanes built from the 1920s through to the end of World War Two became commonly known as \"autogiros\" (or the more generic \"autogyros\"), regardless of the manufacturer. A gyroplane is an aircraft that derives most, if not all, of its lift from the unpowered autorotation of a horizontally mounted rotor or rotors. Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical \"jump\" takeoffs."

They employed standard airplane-type control surfaces (elevator, aileron, and rudder) and the rotor blades all maintained a fixed pitch. The stubby monoplane wing did not serve primarily for the generation of lift. Rather, it was a convenient means of mounting the ailerons and providing stability. It also had the unintended benefit of making the aircraft appear more conventional to skeptical airplane operators who were doubtful about flying without fixed wings."

As the rotors on the C.1 autorotated at different speeds, rendering the aircraft incapable of controlled flight, he decided to switch to a single rotor design. However, the abortive first flight of the new aircraft revealed a problem that he had not considered. As the Autogiro began to gain speed during its takeoff roll, the rotor blade that was turning towards the front of the aircraft received the benefit of additional airspeed because of the forward motion of the Autogiro. However, the blade retreating towards the rear of the autogiro suffered a loss in its airspeed relative to the oncoming air for the same reason. The net effect was a difference in airspeeds of the two blades that naturally caused asymmetry of lift between the two sides of the rotor disc (as lift is a function of airspeed). In turn, this resulted in the Autogiro rolling into the retreating blade side. A subsequent Cierva Autogiro also suffered the same problem and failed to take off successfully."

By incorporating a hinge that allowed each blade to \"flap\" independently at its root, he developed a rotor that equalized lift amongst all of the blades, regardless of whether the Autogiro was flying fast or slow. When the advancing blade generated additional lift because of its higher velocity, the flapping hinge allowed it to rise, which effectively reduced the angle of attack of the blade, thus reducing its lift. On the other side of the rotor, the flapping hinge allow the retreating blade to descend with its reduced lift, which effectively increased its angle of attack, thus generating more lift. This breakthrough was not only an essential component for the Autogiro - it was also necessary for the development of the practical helicopter."

The greatest improvements came in the design of the rotor blades and the hinges, both of which would later prove essential for helicopters."

The airframe was based on the fuselage of the Avro 552A, a variant of the venerable Avro 504 biplane. The most innovative component of the C.8V was its new four-bladed cable-braced rotor that incorporated drag hinges to reduce the stresses on the blades. The \"V\" in the model designation indicated the type of engine used in the variant - in this case, a Wolseley Viper. Cierva constructed six different C.8 configurations, all of which were experimental testbeds built to test improvements in autogiro technology before a production model, the C.19, was to appear in 1929. Given the limited knowledge of rotary wing aerodynamics of the time and the necessity of relying on trial-and-error methods, it is not surprising that Cierva constructed two dozen experimental autogiros before he completed a model worthy of production."

Cierva had equipped the aircraft with an American engine at the request of its buyer, Harold Pitcairn. As a teenager, Pitcairn had developed a fascination with the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft and had avidly followed news of Cierva's progress. In 1924, he had established himself in the aircraft manufacturing industry by building rugged biplanes, one of which, the PA-5 Mailwing (see NASM Collection), was to gain a legendary reputation amongst pilots who flew the nascent airmail routes. Nonetheless, Pitcairn pursued his dream to enter the then highly dubious field of rotary-wing aviation. In 1925 and 1926 he traveled to England for discussions with Cierva about either license-building Autogiros or using them as the basis of his own helicopter designs. While there with his engineer, Agnew Larsen, Pitcairn viewed film footage of the aircraft in operation. They observed that, while the Autogiro was capable of landing in short distances within a confined space, it also required considerable amounts of high-speed taxiing to build up sufficient rotor rpm to take off. Clearly, the ability to land short was of little value without the capability to take off from the same terrain. Nonetheless, Pitcairn remained interested, and in the summer of 1928 he returned to England and flew in the C.8, which greatly impressed him. A rope sling pulled by a ground crew spun up the rotor of the C.8 to near takeoff rpm, which meant that less taxiing was required before a takeoff of only (100 ft). Pitcairn decided to purchase one of the experimental Cierva C.8s as a testbed for his own company's rotary wing program."

After Cierva confirmed that this would not be an issue, Pitcairn agreed to purchase a new C.8 with the Wright engine. On December 11, 1928, the C.8W arrived in the United States onboard the S.S. Aquitania. Pitcairn planned to have the Autogiro make its flight on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Wright brother's first powered flight, on December 17, at his Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania airfield. However, he was conservative when dealing with the experimental testing of the newly reassembled aircraft and was extremely anxious that all should go well on the first flight. Thus, not until December 18, would the C.8W perform the first flight of a gyroplane in the United States, with Cierva test pilot, Arthur \"Dizzy\" Rawson at the controls. Pitcairn himself flew the aircraft the following day. Whatever doubts Pitcairn had concerning the potential of rotary-wing aircraft evaporated as he completely reorganized his company to support autogiro production. His first step was to acquire the American patent rights to Cierva's innovations and to manage and license them under the direction of the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of America. This enterprise, later renamed the Autogiro Company of America, would remain separate from the production side of Pitcairn Aircraft, which would become the Pitcairn Autogiro Company, Inc. in 1933."

                "content": "Testing of the C.8W proceeded well, but it was immediately apparent to Pitcairn and his staff that the aircraft required substantial improvements in performance before it could hope to become a commercial success. One problem was that rotor flapping was unchecked, so that at speeds greater than 161 kph (100 mph) it was possible for the rotor to strike the fuselage - with catastrophic results. By the end of 1929, a three-degree reduction in the angle of incidence of the autogiro's fixed wing reduced this hazard significantly by altering the attitude of the aircraft in flight. Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in). The modification worked extremely well, and was a staple on almost all winged autogiros until the advent of wingless, direct-control versions."

The minimal takeoff and landing rolls of Pitcairn's proposed Autogiros promised that the well-to-do could operate from their lawns, while conventional aircraft were becoming increasingly tied to the fixed infrastructure of the local airfields. Unfortunately, Pitcairn's timing was technically fortuitous but commercially disastrous as his new autogiro venture coincided with the advent of the Great Depression. Despite the best efforts of numerous entrepreneurs, general aviation was to remain the purview of the wealthy throughout this period and the company struggled to survive. Most of the company's Autogiro sales were to demonstration pilots who made their living performing at airshows and using the aircraft as a highly visible flying billboard, either on its own or towing banners."

The C.8W did much to publicize the Autogiro during the development of Pitcairn's initial design, the PCA-1 (see NASM Collection). By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration. Also in the audience was the Spanish ambassador, who had come to see one of his nation's greatest aeronautical contributions in action. Two years later, Pitcairn's first production model, the PCA-2, would land on the South Lawn of the White House."

One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s."

After the C.8W finished its useful life as a testbed upon completion of the PCA-1 series of experimental Autogiros, it lay dormant for a brief time. Pitcairn then decided to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution's repository of historic aircraft at the urging of Paul Garber, who attended to the Smithsonian's aeronautics collection. The last flight of the C.8W occurred on July 22, 1931, when Pitcairn test pilot Jim Ray landed the aircraft on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian \"Castle\" after a 209-kilometer (130-mile) flight from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles Abbott, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, personally accepted it into the national collection. The aircraft currently awaits restoration and display. Harold Pitcairn stated at the presentation that \"the time is fast approaching when the air will hold a vast number of similar but more perfected machines, all engaged in the everyday social and commercial activities of our people.\" The gyroplane was unquestionably a safe and economical means of solving the short takeoff and landing problem that had troubled aeronautical engineers for decades. However, the type's limited payload and low airspeeds usually made it a poor substitute for conventional airplanes in the eyes of most operators. Unfortunately, the Autogiro failed to become a widespread commercial success. The advent of the commercial helicopter in the 1940s, with its unique ability to hover, quickly displaced the gyroplane as the predominant rotary-wing aircraft."

                "content": "The word \"Autogiro\" is a proprietary name coined by Juan de la Cierva. His designs were the first aircraft to fall in the gyroplane category. Nonetheless, nearly all gyroplanes built from the 1920s through to the end of World War Two became commonly known as \"autogiros\" (or the more generic \"autogyros\"), regardless of the manufacturer. A gyroplane is an aircraft that derives most, if not all, of its lift from the unpowered autorotation of a horizontally mounted rotor or rotors. Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical \"jump\" takeoffs."

They employed standard airplane-type control surfaces (elevator, aileron, and rudder) and the rotor blades all maintained a fixed pitch. The stubby monoplane wing did not serve primarily for the generation of lift. Rather, it was a convenient means of mounting the ailerons and providing stability. It also had the unintended benefit of making the aircraft appear more conventional to skeptical airplane operators who were doubtful about flying without fixed wings."

As the rotors on the C.1 autorotated at different speeds, rendering the aircraft incapable of controlled flight, he decided to switch to a single rotor design. However, the abortive first flight of the new aircraft revealed a problem that he had not considered. As the Autogiro began to gain speed during its takeoff roll, the rotor blade that was turning towards the front of the aircraft received the benefit of additional airspeed because of the forward motion of the Autogiro. However, the blade retreating towards the rear of the autogiro suffered a loss in its airspeed relative to the oncoming air for the same reason. The net effect was a difference in airspeeds of the two blades that naturally caused asymmetry of lift between the two sides of the rotor disc (as lift is a function of airspeed). In turn, this resulted in the Autogiro rolling into the retreating blade side. A subsequent Cierva Autogiro also suffered the same problem and failed to take off successfully."

By incorporating a hinge that allowed each blade to \"flap\" independently at its root, he developed a rotor that equalized lift amongst all of the blades, regardless of whether the Autogiro was flying fast or slow. When the advancing blade generated additional lift because of its higher velocity, the flapping hinge allowed it to rise, which effectively reduced the angle of attack of the blade, thus reducing its lift. On the other side of the rotor, the flapping hinge allow the retreating blade to descend with its reduced lift, which effectively increased its angle of attack, thus generating more lift. This breakthrough was not only an essential component for the Autogiro - it was also necessary for the development of the practical helicopter."

The most innovative component of the C.8V was its new four-bladed cable-braced rotor that incorporated drag hinges to reduce the stresses on the blades. The \"V\" in the model designation indicated the type of engine used in the variant - in this case, a Wolseley Viper. Cierva constructed six different C.8 configurations, all of which were experimental testbeds built to test improvements in autogiro technology before a production model, the C.19, was to appear in 1929. Given the limited knowledge of rotary wing aerodynamics of the time and the necessity of relying on trial-and-error methods, it is not surprising that Cierva constructed two dozen experimental autogiros before he completed a model worthy of production."

Cierva had equipped the aircraft with an American engine at the request of its buyer, Harold Pitcairn. As a teenager, Pitcairn had developed a fascination with the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft and had avidly followed news of Cierva's progress. In 1924, he had established himself in the aircraft manufacturing industry by building rugged biplanes, one of which, the PA-5 Mailwing (see NASM Collection), was to gain a legendary reputation amongst pilots who flew the nascent airmail routes. Nonetheless, Pitcairn pursued his dream to enter the then highly dubious field of rotary-wing aviation. In 1925 and 1926 he traveled to England for discussions with Cierva about either license-building Autogiros or using them as the basis of his own helicopter designs. While there with his engineer, Agnew Larsen, Pitcairn viewed film footage of the aircraft in operation. They observed that, while the Autogiro was capable of landing in short distances within a confined space, it also required considerable amounts of high-speed taxiing to build up sufficient rotor rpm to take off. Clearly, the ability to land short was of little value without the capability to take off from the same terrain. Nonetheless, Pitcairn remained interested, and in the summer of 1928 he returned to England and flew in the C.8, which greatly impressed him. A rope sling pulled by a ground crew spun up the rotor of the C.8 to near takeoff rpm, which meant that less taxiing was required before a takeoff of only (100 ft). Pitcairn decided to purchase one of the experimental Cierva C.8s as a testbed for his own company's rotary wing program."

After Cierva confirmed that this would not be an issue, Pitcairn agreed to purchase a new C.8 with the Wright engine. On December 11, 1928, the C.8W arrived in the United States onboard the S.S. Aquitania. Pitcairn planned to have the Autogiro make its flight on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Wright brother's first powered flight, on December 17, at his Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania airfield. However, he was conservative when dealing with the experimental testing of the newly reassembled aircraft and was extremely anxious that all should go well on the first flight. Thus, not until December 18, would the C.8W perform the first flight of a gyroplane in the United States, with Cierva test pilot, Arthur \"Dizzy\" Rawson at the controls. Pitcairn himself flew the aircraft the following day. Whatever doubts Pitcairn had concerning the potential of rotary-wing aircraft evaporated as he completely reorganized his company to support autogiro production. His first step was to acquire the American patent rights to Cierva's innovations and to manage and license them under the direction of the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of America. This enterprise, later renamed the Autogiro Company of America, would remain separate from the production side of Pitcairn Aircraft, which would become the Pitcairn Autogiro Company, Inc. in 1933."

One problem was that rotor flapping was unchecked, so that at speeds greater than 161 kph (100 mph) it was possible for the rotor to strike the fuselage - with catastrophic results. By the end of 1929, a three-degree reduction in the angle of incidence of the autogiro's fixed wing reduced this hazard significantly by altering the attitude of the aircraft in flight. Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in). The modification worked extremely well, and was a staple on almost all winged autogiros until the advent of wingless, direct-control versions."

Unfortunately, Pitcairn's timing was technically fortuitous but commercially disastrous as his new autogiro venture coincided with the advent of the Great Depression. Despite the best efforts of numerous entrepreneurs, general aviation was to remain the purview of the wealthy throughout this period and the company struggled to survive. Most of the company's Autogiro sales were to demonstration pilots who made their living performing at airshows and using the aircraft as a highly visible flying billboard, either on its own or towing banners."

By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration. Also in the audience was the Spanish ambassador, who had come to see one of his nation's greatest aeronautical contributions in action. Two years later, Pitcairn's first production model, the PCA-2, would land on the South Lawn of the White House."

Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground.

Early Curtiss engines were designed to power motorcycles. The Curtiss V-X was manufactured in Hammondsport and Buffalo beginning in 1915 to power the R series of Curtiss biplanes, especially the R-6 and R-9 training seaplanes and R-4 training landplane. Modified examples of the latter type were used by the Army in its 1916 operations on the Mexican border and for carrying U.S. mail."

The U.S. Government's Liberty engine fulfilled the need for a higher power engine; therefore, the V-X engines were phased out before reaching large-scale production."

By 1911 he had built several airplanes and had gained extensive experience as an exhibition pilot. He began testing a new airplane in the spring of 1911. It was similar to the basic Curtiss pusher design that was becoming quite popular with builders by this time, but it was innovative in that it had steel-tube structural components. It was powered by a 60-horsepower Hall-Scott V-8. Baldwin called his new machine the Red Devil III, and thereafter each of his airplanes would be known as a Baldwin Red Devil. Baldwin built approximately six Red Devils. Most were powered by the Hall-Scott, but Curtiss engines were also occasionally used. By mid-1911, Baldwin was training pilots, taking up passengers, and performing regularly with Red Devil aircraft at air meets. He advertised Red Devils for sale into 1913."

He was born in 1854, and after a stint as a brakeman on the Illinois railroad as a youth, he joined the circus as an acrobat. One of the circus attractions was a hot air balloon, with which Baldwin ascended, seated on a trapeze suspended beneath. He made his first trip aloft in 1875. Soon he enhanced the act by performing acrobatics on the trapeze at several hundred feet, which, by 1885, led to parachute jumps from the balloon. His successful daring quickly led to a world tour, including a special performance before the Prince of Wales in London. Baldwin's manager for the tour billed him as \"Captain\" Baldwin, a nickname by which he would be known from then on."

Between 1900 and 1908, he built a number of non-rigid airships. Among the most famous was the California Arrow, powered by a small Curtiss engine and piloted by Roy Knabenshue at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. In 1905, the Baldwin Airship Company was incorporated, and Captain Baldwin soon became a major name in the early American aviation circles. In 1907, the Baldwin company was commissioned by the U.S. Army Signal Corps to build a 600 cu m (20,000 cu ft) capacity airship. The 29 m (96 ft) long non-rigid was powered by a 20-horsepower Curtiss engine, traveled at a speed of 20 mph, and had a total lifting capability of 617 kg (1,360 lb). It was tested successfully for the Army in August 1908 and was designated the SC-1."

It was a tractor biplane with a biplane tail similar to the well-known Farman design, and it had a large vertical surface mounted above the top wing for lateral steering. The original 25-horsepower, four-cylinder Curtiss engine was quickly replaced by a Curtiss V-8. By the summer of 1910, Baldwin was testing a second airplane at Mineola, Long Island. This aircraft was similar to the Curtiss biplanes of the day, featuring a centrally-mounted pusher engine and a forward elevator supported by booms ahead of the wings."

In December 1910, he formed an exhibition team with J.C. \"Bud\" Mars and Tod Shriver and began a tour of the Pacific. They made flights in Honolulu during the week of December 31, 1910, en route to the Philippines, China, and Japan. One of the airplanes was sold to a school in Manila. The group returned to the United States in the spring of 1911."

                "content": "Shortly after his return from the Pacific, Baldwin was testing a new airplane at Mineola. The new aircraft was again similar to the basic Curtiss pusher design that was becoming quite popular with builders by this time, but it was innovative in that it was constructed of steel tubing. Built for Baldwin by C. and A. Wittemann of Staten Island, New York, it was powered by a 60-horsepower, Hall-Scott V-8, and could fly at the then impressive speed of 60 mph. Baldwin called his new machine the Red Devil III, and thereafter each of his airplanes would be known as a Baldwin Red Devil. The origin of the name appears to stem from Baldwin's painting his aircraft bright crimson overall. There is also an unsubstantiated story that following an accident, Baldwin emerged from the wreckage of his airplane angrily voicing some choice phrases in the presence of a young girl who had witnessed the incident. The girl purportedly left the scene sneering at Baldwin, \"old red devil.\" Whatever the truth of the origin of the name, Baldwin's distinctive red airplanes were collectively known as Red Devils."

                "content": "Between 1910 and 1913, Baldwin built approximately six Red Devils, although that is a very rough estimate. Most were powered by the Hall-Scott, but Curtiss engines were also occasionally used. By mid-1911, Baldwin was training pilots, taking up passengers, and performing regularly with Red Devil aircraft at air meets. He advertised Red Devils for sale into 1913, and they were featured in Hall-Scott's advertising in this period. During these years, he continued his domestic and international tours. Beginning in late 1911, with Lee Hammond, he made another major swing through the Orient."

                "content": "The history of the NASM Baldwin Red Devil is very obscure. It differs from other Red Devils in a number of ways, most significantly in that is has no forward elevator. Also, it has single ailerons mounted between the wings, rather than the trailing edge ailerons on both wings that were typical of other Red Devils. One photograph exists of a Red Devil with no forward elevator and trailing edge ailerons, as well as a picture of yet another with a forward elevator and single interplane ailerons, thus demonstrating that the unusual features of the NASM airplane did appear on other confirmed Red Devils. Unfortunately, no picture of the NASM Red Devil exists showing the airplane before the First World War, when it was presumably built and flown. Another apparent difference of the NASM airplane is the engine type. It came to the museum with a 50-horsepower Maximotor B-4 installed. Although no contemporary documentation cites any Red Devils as powered by a Maximotor, the holes in the engine mount of the NASM airplane suggest that this was the original engine in this airframe."

Nothing is known of how, when, or from whom Roosevelt Field acquired the airplane. Indeed, its only documentation as even being a Baldwin Red Devil is its characterization as such by Roosevelt Field. Nevertheless, the steel-tube structural components and general design of the NASM airplane are consistent with known features of Baldwin Red Devils. So there is little reason to doubt that it is a Red Devil."

It was used on Apollo lunar landing missions to preserve a lunar-like vacuum around the samples and protect them from the shock environment of the return flight to earth. An aluminum mesh liner helped absorb impacts. Prior to flight, each box was loaded with sample container bags and other sample containment devices. The \"rock box\" was then closed under vacuum so that it would not contain pressure greater than the lunar ambient pressure. On the moon, while samples were being loaded, the seals were protected by a Teflon film and a cloth cover which were removed just prior to closing the box. Two ALSRC's were used on each mission."

Applying the expertise of French Chief Engineer Louis Coatalen, its first aircraft engines were designed in 1913. A total of 350 Cossack engines were produced between August 1914 and December 1918. These engines powered the: Handley Page H.P.11 O/100 Type O; Short 310-A4 and Short 310-B North Sea Scout; R36 (Beardmore) Admiralty dirigible airship and R38 (Royal Airship Works) Admiralty dirigible airship. Sunbeam\u2019s engines were the favored supplier to the Royal Navy Air Service until late in World War I. After Coatalen\u2019s return to France in 1923, Sunbeam effectively left the aircraft engine business."

Heath was first to use machines for mass production of aircraft propellers and, under the Paragon trademark, these were widely used in World War I. Like most propellers of that era, construction was a wood laminate because of light weight, strength, fabrication ease, and resistance to fatigue in a vibrating and flexing environment."

The objective was a power plant for large seaplanes, such as the British Naval Air Forces used in patrolling the North Sea for enemy submarines. The quickest way to develop such an engine was thought to be through enlarging the 8-cylinder Curtiss VX engine into a 12-cylinder version. The first 12-cylinder Curtiss engine was designated V-4."

Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Shuttle astronauts wore this type of flight jacket to work and public appearances. The decorations told the individual's story. Here, the leather nametag identifies the mission on which Ride earned her astronaut wings, STS-7. The patch across the chest indicates that she was one of 35 astronauts selected in 1978 as the first group chosen for the space shuttle program. On the right shoulder is the patch for her other mission. The American flag and NASA logo patches appear on all astronaut uniforms. Dr. Ride\u2019s partner, Dr. Tam O\u2019Shaughnessy, donated the jacket to the Museum in 2013."

The first Curtiss engines were air cooled but, to achieve higher power, Curtiss began to develop liquid-cooled engines. Historical evidence suggests that this Model L artifact was one of two higher-performance engines built by Curtiss for his experimental monoplane that was shown, but not flown, at the 1910 Gordon Bennett Race held at Belmont Park, N.Y. Both engines were later assigned to Eugene Ely, a pilot for Curtiss, who used them in exhibition and demonstration flights. It is likely that one of those engines powered the aircraft which crashed in 1912 at Macon, Georgia, killing Ely."

After several failures with designs that were too fragile and under-powered to sustain themselves, Langley had his first genuine success on May 6, 1896, with his Aerodrome Number 5. It made the world's first successful flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven, heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made on May 6, one of 1,005 m (3,300 ft) and a second of 700 m (2,300 ft), at a speed of approximately 40 kph (25 mph). On both occasions, the Aerodrome Number 5 landed in the water, as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear."

He became the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1887. Langley had begun serious investigation into heavier-than-air flight several years earlier while at the then Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh (now the University of Pittsburgh). He had erected a huge, 18.3 m (60 ft) diameter whirling arm at the university's Allegheny Observatory to perform aerodynamic research. At full speed, the tips of the whirling arm approached seventy miles per hour. Langley mostly ran tests with flat plates, but he also mounted small model airplanes he called aerostats, and even stuffed birds, on the arm. He also conducted an extensive series of experiments with rubber band-powered models."

He then moved away from purely theoretical aerodynamic research, and began work aimed at engineering an actual flying machine. In 1891, he started to experiment with large, tandem-winged models powered by small steam and gasoline engines. Another large whirling arm, 9 m (29.5 ft) in diameter, was set up at the Smithsonian to test curved wing shapes and propellers, probably in connection with the design of these large powered models that Langley called aerodromes. After several failures with designs that were too fragile and under-powered to sustain themselves, Langley had his first genuine success with his Aerodrome No.5."

The wings and tail were wood-frame, covered with fine silk. The power plant was a single-cylinder, one-horsepower steam engine equipped with a double-action piston with a slide valve, and a flashtube boiler fired by a pressure burner that vaporized gasoline. The engine drove twin propellers, centrally mounted between the front and rear sets of wings, through a system of shafts and bevel gears. The aircraft weighed approximately 11kg (24.3 lb) ready for flight."

Heretofore having only produced pusher aircraft, Glenn Curtiss hired an experienced European designer to lead the new project named B. Douglas Thomas, who had worked for Avro and Sopwith in England. The Jenny performed admirably as a trainer for the U.S. Air Service during World War I, but its more significant role in aviation history was as a barnstorming and mail-carrying airplane in the 1920s. Large numbers of relatively inexpensive war surplus Jennys were available in the United States after 1918. Its affordability, ease of operation, and versatility made the Jenny the signature airplane of the barnstorming era. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918 directly from the U.S. War Department. It is one of the finest remaining examples of this truly classic airplane."

For many, the Jenny would be the first airplane that they would see close-up, and those with a few dollars in hand and their fear in check, typically would make their first flight in a Jenny."

Douglas Thomas. Thomas had been employed as an assistant chief engineer with Sopwith Aviation when Curtiss met him on a trip to England. Impressed with Thomas' aeronautical knowledge, Curtiss hired him and commissioned him to design a two-seat, tractor airplane around the Curtiss-built OX-5 engine."

The designation officially became the JN-2. In March 1915, Curtiss began construction of a 110,000-square-foot factory in Buffalo, New York. This factory ultimately produced Jennys at the rate of 100 per month."

Gabriel began his formal aviation career in 1903 when he was engaged by a prominent French aeronautical promoter, Ernest Archdeacon, to build gliders for him. In 1905 he formed the first commercial aircraft manufacturing company in Europe with the soon-to-be famous Louis Bl\u00e9riot. Numerous disputes between the two quickly arose, however, and Voisin bought out Bl\u00e9riot's interest in the venture in 1906. He immediately reformed the company with his brother Charles, thus establishing the highly successful Appareils d'Aviation Les Fr\u00e8res Voisin. The firm's first truly successful airplane appeared in 1907."

Designated the Type L by the Voisin factory, this seminal airplane was an equal-span biplane with no dihedral, with a short nacelle carrying the crew of two in front and an 80-horsepower Le Rh\u00f4ne 9C engine at the rear. A cruciform tail was attached to the wings with a set of booms, and it had a quadricycle landing gear. A second pre-war military design, similar to the Type L, powered by a 70-horsepower Gnome 7A engine, was produced in 1913. Although they were largely obsolete by the start of the war, the sturdiness and the reliability of these, and subsequent, Voisin aircraft enabled them to form the backbone of the French night bomber force until late in 1918."

Voisin 3 units staged a retaliatory attack against the Badische Anilin Gesellschaft at Ludwigshaven, Germany, on May 26, 1915, shortly after the German Army introduced poison gas in battle. Successful daytime attacks on targets within Germany ensued, but by 1916 the Voisin 3 and its immediate successors became vulnerable to new, better performing, German fighters. (The Voisin Type 4 was similar to the Type 3, but was fitted with a 47 mm cannon and used primarily for ground strafing. The Types 5 and 6 were virtually the same as the Type 3, except that they had more powerful Salmson engines.) The Voisins were slow and with their pusher configuration they were defenseless from the rear. Despite these limitations, these rugged and reliable aircraft still had a role to play. Voisins were used as trainers and for night missions for the remainder of the war. Voisin pusher aircraft were supplied to, or built under license by, twelve countries, including Britain, Russia, Italy, and the United States."

But the Hispanso-Suizas were not available in sufficient numbers, and a 220-horsepower Peugeot 8 Aa inline was substituted. To accommodate the bulkier and heavier Peugeot, the Type 8 required an enlarged and strengthened fuselage, and greater wingspan. It was fitted with either a single machine gun or a 37 mm cannon."

The Type 10, with improved range, speed, and bomb load, replaced the Voisin Type 8 early in 1918. (Only one Type 9 was built.

However, by the time the aircraft were transported to the U.S. and prepared for flight demonstrations, they were already outmoded. On July 12, 1918, Lt. Col. L.S. Horner, of the War Department's Bureau of Aircraft Production, wrote to Smithsonian Institution Secretary, Charles Walcott, regarding \"obsolete airplanes for exhibition purposes,\" offering to the Institution the Voisin, the Caudron, and the Farman. The offer was accepted and the three airplanes were delivered to the museum on September 16 and 17, 1918. The Farman was very incomplete and was deemed unacceptable for exhibition. It was returned to the War Department in June 1921. (Because of an oversight when packing the Farman for shipment, its wings remained at the Smithsonian until September 1925, when they were either returned to the War Department or destroyed. The record is unclear.)"

This dangerous feature not only made communication between the crew members difficult, but it was hazardous in a crash. The much-touted Liberty engine was also at first a cause for concern. The prototype was designed and built in only six weeks. Not surprisingly, they too had technical problems. Once resolved, however, with a maximum speed of 198 kph (124 mph), the Liberty-powered DH-4 was able to match or even surpass the speed of most of the fighters of the time."

On October 8, 1918, they flew repeated missions over enemy lines to drop much-needed supplies to the survivors of the \"Lost Battalion\" of the 77th Division. At the cost of their lives, they accomplished the first successful American combat airlift operation.

(Lowe-Willard-Fowler) Company of College Point, New York, converted DH-4s to single-seat DH-4B mailplanes, with a compartment for 225 kg (496 lb) of mail replacing the front seat. For night flying, special flame-supressing exhaust stacks were fitted to prevent night blindness. The rugged DH-4 proved to be ideally suited for the task of delivering mail throughout the United States. Altogether, more than 200 of these DH-4Bs were used in a pioneering role by the U.S. Post office over a period of eight years. After 1927, a number of air mail DH-4s were modified or rebuilt as forest fire patrol aircraft to fly long-range patrols over the expansive western wilderness. A few were transferred to the new airlines that took over the mail services in 1926-1930."

Called the Air Service Transport 2, or T-2, it was the fourth in a series of commercial transport designs by the Fokker Company. Two of these airplanes, originally carrying the designation F-IV, were sold to the U.S. Army Air Service in June 1922."

It was powered by an American-built 420-horsepower Liberty V-12 engine. In its standard configuration, the Fokker had a single pilot's position located in a forward open cockpit to the left side of the engine. The enclosed cabin carried 8 to 10 passengers and their baggage."

Modifications would be required, however. The center section of the wing would have to be reinforced to handle the added weight resulting from the greatly increased fuel supply. The standard 492-liter (130-gallon) fuel tank, located in the leading edge of the wing, was supplemented by a 1,552-liter (410-gallon) tank in the wing center section and a 700-liter (185-gallon) tank mounted in the fuselage cabin area. Also installed in the cabin was a second set of controls to facili-tate control of the airplane when the two-man crew exchanged positions."

On the first try, fog in the mountain passes 80 km (50 mi) east of San Diego forced Kelly and Macready to turn back. They remained aloft long enough, however, to test the performance of the airplane under extended flight conditions. The second attempt ended at Fort Benjamin Harrison, near Indianapolis, when a cracked water jacket caused the engine to seize. In the course of the preparations and the two unsuccessful attempts at a west-east crossing, several new engines were installed, and many minor modifications were made to the T-2. All of this work was carried out at the Army Air Service installation at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio."

At takeoff, the airplane had a gross weight of 4,932 kg (10,850 lb)-only 68 kg (150 lb) less than the T-2's specified limit of 4,990 kg (11,000 lb). Lieutenant Kelly was at the controls first, and flew as far as Richmond, Indiana. Kelly then switched places with Lieutenant Macready, who flew the air-craft until midnight, at which time they were approaching the Arkansas River, the 1, 900 km (1,188 mi) point. They exchanged positions there, again at Santa Rosa, New Mexico, at 6:00 a.m. the following morning, and once more as they crossed the Great Divide at an altitude of 3,110 km (10,200 ft). Macready landed the T-2 in San Diego on May 3 at 12:26 p.m., local time, completing the nonstop transcontinental journey in an official time of 26 hours, 50 minutes, and 38 3/5 seconds. The T-2 had flown 3,950 km (2,470 mi) at an average ground speed of 147 kph (92 mph)."

He built upon the feat on January 18, 1911, when he landed a Curtiss pusher on a platform built on the after deck of the cruiser, USS Pennsylvania. After having lunch with naval officers in the wardroom, Ely took off from the same platform and flew back to shore. The flights marked the beginning of carrier aviation."

This feature, incorporated in other Curtiss designs, appealed to exhibition pilots and helped Curtiss command up to 80 percent of the exhibition market.

The replica incorporated some parts from original 1912 aircraft and was initially powered by a Curtiss OX-5 engine. It was later fitted with a 50 horsepower Curtiss V8 engine of the type that powered the Reims Racer in 1909. The replica Curtiss D-III Headless Pusher was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1925."

The fuselage was monocoque construction covered with a 0.032-inch aluminum alloy, and could accommodate only the pilot.

Following wartime service as a civilian flight instructor both in France and the United States, Domenjoz made one final barnstorming tour with his Bl\u00e9riot in 1919."

Louis Bl\u00e9riot, a French engineer and manufacturer of automobile head lamps and other accessories, first became interested in aeronautics in 1901, when he constructed an experimental ornithopter. During the next eight years he moved through a series of ten distinct aircraft designs, only one of which was capable of making a flight of more than ten minutes."

It was first flown at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a military parade ground-turned-flying-field, on January 23, 1909. Further trials and various modifications proceeded through the spring. By the end of May, the Type XI was fitted with a 25-horsepower, three-cylinder Anzani engine, and throughout the remainder of the spring and summer Bl\u00e9riot was flying with regular success. The Anzani was somewhat crude, but it had a reputation for reliability, which was critical to Bl\u00e9riot's next challenge."

It was not the longest flight to date either in duration or distance. But the symbolic impact of conquering the Channel by airplane made it the most widely acclaimed flight before Lindbergh. For the effort, Bl\u00e9riot captured the London Daily Mail prize of $2,500 that had been put up by the newspaper the year before for any successful cross-Channel airplane flight. Bl\u00e9riot's original Type XI today is in the possession of the Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris."

The airplane was purchased on July 31, 1914, by the Swiss aviator John Domenjoz, a Bl\u00e9riot company flight instructor. Domenjoz had recently earned a reputation as one of Europe's most celebrated stunt pilots while performing in major European cities during the early summer of 1914.

He would often perform extended inverted flight lasting more than a minute. Flying at Buenos Aires in April 1915, he performed 40 consecutive loops in 28 minutes. Such feats earned him the nickname \"upside-down Domenjoz.\" He returned to the United States in the fall of 1915 and made headlines flying in and around New York City. Domenjoz and his Bl\u00e9riot continued the tour through the American south and midwest late in 1915 and early in 1916. After a stop in Havana, Cuba, he headed north again for another New York engagement."

In May 1917 he was back in the United States for another exhibition season. Following wartime service as a civilian flight instructor at Park Field in Memphis, Tennessee, Domenjoz made one final barnstorming tour in 1919. He then placed his beloved Bl\u00e9riot in storage on a Long Island farm and returned to France, where he remained for seventeen years."

It remained there until 1950 when the Smithsonian Institution purchased it with two other pioneer aircraft and a number of early engines. It was fully restored by the National Air and Space Museum in 1979 for exhibition in the museum's Early Flight gallery."

These were the Piper PA-11 Cub Special and the Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser. Walter Jamoneau, who was head of the engineering department at Piper for many years, modified the J-5 into the PA-12. Test flights were made in December 1945, and the first production version of the aircraft appeared in February 1946. A four-place version, known as the PA-14 Family Cruiser and featuring a 115-hp Lycoming engine, was built in 1948."

The PA-12 was also fabric-covered, over a welded metal tubular frame and wooden wing spars, and featured a Lycoming O-325-C engine, fully cowled. Later models of the PA-12 had as optional equipment a slightly more powerful engine. Standard features on the PA-12 included an electric starter, navigation lights, and a cabin heater. The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser was used in a number of roles, from private pleasure flying to light cargo carrying and many are still flying. It was also successful in the export market."

Evans and thirty-nine year old George Truman, two Air Force Reserve officers and flight instructors at College Park Airport in Maryland, became interested in the flight as a result of an offhand remark by Evans stating that a Piper Cub could fly around the world. Neither Evans nor Truman was wealthy, so they had to convince Piper, Lycoming, and other manufacturers to donate the necessary equipment. Finally, they were able to arrange for two fully equipped, secondhand Piper Super Cruisers to be furnished for the trip. These planes were modified by the addition of a metal, rather than wood, fixed-pitch propeller, extra instruments, sophisticated radio and navigation equipment, and two extra 50-gallon fuel tanks for a total supply of 138 gallons to allow for 26 hours of endurance. They also carried survival equipment. Evans built a drift meter to help with navigation for both aircraft as well."

The flight took just over four months and encompassed 22,436 miles. Weather was the biggest problem, confining them to the ground for many days. Flying above the overcast for 950 miles from Greenland to Iceland, they flew south of the island, realized their mistake and turned back, landing just before fog settled on the airport. After an uneventful but pleasant time in Europe, the pilots were detained six days by the authorities in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, even though their papers were in order. Several 1,000-mile legs took nine to twelve hours with an approximate airspeed of 112 mph and prevailing weather conditions. After two stops in China, they arrived in Japan where they met a USAF B-17 that was to escort them across the North Pacific Ocean to the Alaska mainland. Then, the weather encountered in Alaska and Canada proved to be the worst of the entire trip."

Enroute, flags of each visited nation were hand-painted on the left fuselages and 53 of their 55 stops were painted onto the right side of the fuselages.

The original flag portion of the fuselage panel was saved and is in environmental storage. The flags and stopping points were repainted onto the fuselage sides.

It was built as a replacement for the outdated Albatros and Pfalz D.III scouts and the outclassed Fokker Dr.I triplane. The Pfalz D.XII was a single-seat, two-bay biplane fighter of all-wood construction with a semi-monocoque plywood fuselage. It carried two forward-firing Maxim machine guns synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The airplane was powered by a six-cylinder, 180-horsepower, water-cooled, in-line Mercedes D.IIIa engine. It had a top speed of 170 kph (106 mph) and a ceiling of 5,640 m (18,500 ft)."

Four of those aircraft survive. One is on display at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Air in Paris, another is in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The two other examples are former Hollywood movie performers. One of these resides at the Champlin Fighter Museum in Mesa, Arizona, and the other at NASM."

A contemporary document from the U.S. Air Service, entitled \"Reports of Inspection of (Captured) German Airplanes,\" refers to two Pfalz D.XIIs that were inspected at Coblenz on January 1, 1919. According to a 1949 letter from Louis C. \"Buck\" Kennell, the donor of the NASM airplane, these two Pfalz aircraft were brought to this country as part of Allied war reparations. Kennell also related that these airplanes were then sold as war surplus, brought to Hollywood, and appeared in the 1930 Howard Hughes epic, Hell's Angels, and the first Dawn Patrol film, also made in 1930. Kennell's assertion that the airplanes appeared in Hell's Angels is probably true, but remains unconfirmed. After their use in Dawn Patrol, the two aircraft were sent to a Hollywood back lot for storage. Most of the existing film footage of the Pfalz comes from this movie, and there are several stills of the NASM aircraft from the film."

The Smithsonian Institution received the Pfalz D.XII from Kennell in 1951. It remained in storage until 1963, when it was sent to the Experimental Aircraft Association Museum to be restored. It was painted in typical wartime colors and markings for a Pfalz D.XII, although no information exists on precisely how the NASM Pfalz appeared during the war."

The little Pitcairns, flying by night, followed the newly lighted airways between Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, and Atlanta.

Halliburton lec a group that restored the airplane as a gift for a Capt. Edward V. Rickenbacker, who had guided Eastern for so many years.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation was commissioned to design the turbojet engines, and together the teams took on the challenge. After exhaustive tests on the number and size of the jet engines, it was determined that two 19-inch-diameter turbojets mounted in the wing roots would provide the necessary power and fuel economy. The final configuration emerged with two Westinghouse 19 XB-2B engines, a low-wing, single-tail fuselage with the horizontal stabilizer clear of the exhaust, and a single cockpit forward of the leading edge of the wing. The nose held four 0.50-caliber guns. The prototype XFD-1 Phantom first flew on January 26, 1945."

Impressed with its performance, the Navy ordered production versions, designated the FH-1. Delivery to fleet squadrons began in July 1947, with Fighter Squadron 17A (VF-17A) becoming the first Navy jet squadron to be carrier-qualified and the first operational shipboard jet fighter squadron in the world. This crucial test occurred during carrier operation trials aboard the USS Saipan in May 1948. Pilots of VF-17A made 176 takeoffs, took wave-offs, and simulated combat maneuvers. The Phantom met all the requirements and proved the soundness of the fundamental concept of carrier-based jet aircraft. With the completion of these trials, a new age in naval aviation had begun."

The only other successful American fighter aircraft of World War II with a similar heavy gun battery installed in the nose was the Lockheed P-38 Lightning (see NASM collection). Unusual for an experimental prototype, \"Lulu-Belle\" flew from the outset with all six guns installed, and several early flights involved gunnery trials."

When it came time to put the XP-80 into production, the General Electric Company was ready to supply, in quantity, a brand new turbojet engine. Development on the new GE I-40 had begun in March 1943 and the company ran tests on the first I-40 engine on January 9, 1944. This power plant was more powerful than the Goblin but also larger in size. The Lockheed jet fighter would require considerable redesign to accommodate the I-40. The AAF issued a contract for two new XP-80A prototypes with a bigger fuselage to house the engine, and a pressurized cockpit."

The XP-80 roll rate was very rapid too. By July 1944, just as Allied pilots began to encounter the first Me 262s over Europe, \"Lulu-Belle\" starred in a series of exercises conducted to develop tactics that American heavy bomber crews could use against attacks by jet fighters. The trials showed that enemy jet fighter pilots would much prefer rear aspect attacks. In attacking from the front, jet and bomber merged very rapidly and the enemy jet pilot had almost no time to shoot accurately. Based on these findings, AAF planners moved the formations of American fighters protecting the bombers to higher altitudes. This gave the fighter crews space to dive and gain speed on the German jets when they attacked from the bombers from behind. These tactics proved effective in fending off Me 262 attacks during the last months of the war and undoubtedly saved the lives of many American bomber crewmen."

Maintenance problems frequently kept the aircraft grounded and \"Lulu-Belle\" finished its career in 1946 as a test-bed for various configurations of the Goblin engine.

The AAF designated them YP-80As and sent two each to England and Italy as Me 262 pilots began to take their toll of Allied bomber crews. A fast and reliable foil to the deadly Messerschmitt was sorely needed. However, not enough production P-80 fighters, or crews trained to fly them, were available to equip a front line squadron. An AAF order raising the production priority to the highest level, equaling priority for Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers (see NASM collection), could not speed quantity manufacturing. The rush to field the brand new fighter may have lead to several fatal accidents. Among those killed in P-80s were Lockheed test pilot Milo Burcham and America's top ace and Medal of Honor winner, Major Richard I. Bong. After World War II, the P-80 \"Shooting Star\" became a fine, reliable frontline fighter. A highlight of the type's service record occurred came on November 8, 1950, when Lt. Russ Brown, flying an F-80C of the 16th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, shot down a North Korean MiG-15 in the first all-jet air-to-air combat."

With the Hawker Hurricane, it successfully defended England against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, and throughout the war it saw service on every major front. Performance and handling were superb. The Mk.VII, the second high-altitude version developed, was used in England and the Middle East. Several Mk 2EXVIs, the last production version to use the Merlin engine, remained in service through 1950. In all, 20,351 Spitfires were built."

Mitchell designed racers to enter in the Schneider Trophy Races, with the British government subsidizing the project. Mitchell designed every British winner after World War I, and on September 13, 1931, his S.6B brought the Schneider Cup permanently home to Britain by winning the third consecutive race."

His seaplane racers gave way to landplane designs, incorporating such new features as an enclosed cockpit, retractable undercarriage, and the new Rolls Royce PV-12 liquid-cooled engine (later named the Merlin). With these elements, he increased the endurance and speed of his planes. The British government was now issuing specifications for fighter aircraft, which reflected its watchful eye on political developments in Germany. When a specification was issued for a fighter with eight instead of the usual four machine guns installed, Mitchell was ready with the design for the Supermarine Type 300. It surpassed Air Ministry requirements and was accepted. Another specification was written for the construction of the prototype."

Mitchell did not live to see his Spitfire reach production; he died of cancer on June 11,1937, at the age of forty-two. But the groundwork had now been established, and J. Smith, his chief draftsman, took his place as chief designer."

They were also employed in sea-air rescue operations.

A. designed and built the Folgore (Lightning), which was based on an earlier Macchi design powered by a radial engine, the C.200 Saeta (Thunderbolt). To create the Folgore, Macchi's chief of design, Mario Castoldi, adapted the Saeta airframe to the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled engine. Italy was a significant air-faring nation during the mid-1930s but its aviation industry began to lag late in the decade, particularly in engine development. No indigenous, in-line powerplant of sufficient power was available when the war started so early in 1940 Macchi had to import the German engine as a private venture. The results were impressive.

Although it was available too late to affect the outcome in North Africa, the new Macchi C.202 proved clearly superior to both the American Curtiss P-40 and the British Hawker Hurricane. Pilots flying the Italian fighter outperformed all opponents except Supermarine Spitfires and North American P-51 Mustangs. Folgore pilots lauded the fighter's finger-light handling and superb agility."

No record is known of the original markings and but curators chose to copy aircraft 90-4 of the 4\u00ba Stormo (Wing), 10\u00ba Gruppo (Squadron), and 90\u00ba Squadriglia (Flight) that operated in Libya during the summer of 1942.

The Reisen outclassed all Allied fighter aircraft for the first six months of the war until American carrier forces stopped the Japanese in the Coral Sea and at Midway in May and June 1942, respectively. The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers at Midway underscored a deadly trend. The Japanese were losing experienced pilots and aircraft faster than they could replace them. Yet for almost two more years the ZEKE, as the Allies code-named it, remained an ominous threat."

To satisfy these demanding requirements, Mitsubishi designer Jiro Horikoshi and his team focused specifically on reducing airframe weight as much as possible. Horikoshi used a new lightweight aluminum alloy developed in Japan and he chose to omit armor plate and self-sealing fuel tanks from the design. These protective devices weighed hundred of kilograms and could not be incorporated if Mitsubishi hoped to meet the performance requirements specified by the navy. Yet the lack of these components eventually became the Zero's undoing."

But as combat experience mounted and training improved, the American tactics began to change. U. S. Navy and Army pilots avoided the turning and looping dogfight and began to engage the Zeros only when they could surprise the Japanese pilots by attacking with a height or speed advantage. This type of attack consisted of a single, straight pass with guns blazing. The American pilot then continued away from the Zero using his superior speed to zoom to safety or circle around at a distance and attack again. This idea and other tactics transformed pilots flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat (once considered totally obsolete against the Zero) into formidable opponents more than capable of destroying the Japanese fighter."

The F6F-3 Hellcat entered combat in August 1943 and the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine that propelled it also gave the Hellcat pilot enough speed and climb to engage or avoid the Zero without regard for the tactical situation."

S. Navy flashlight were also discovered inside the left wing. Curators selected the markings of an aircraft from the 261st Naval Air Corps because an aircraft of this unit was captured at Saipan. The 261st NAC was more commonly known as the Tiger Corps. It was activated on June 1, 1943, and was soon assigned to the newly organized 1st Air Fleet. The Tiger Corps moved to the Marianas on February 16, 1944, and participated in some of the fiercest fighting of the war."

Serving throughout the war, Dauntlesses would sink more than 300,000 tons of enemy shipping, including at least 18 warships, ranging from submarines to battleships. During 1942, SBDs were the primary weapon in the U.S. war effort in the Pacific, almost single-handedly sinking six enemy carriers."

United States Marine Corps pilots had experimented with the technique as early as 1919 although it was not known by that name at the time. With the commissioning of the first carrier, the USS Langley, the Navy realized there would be limitations to the size of aircraft used at sea. Carrier planes could not hope to carry the same bomb load as shore-based aircraft, so they needed to be able to deliver each bomb as accurately as possible. Dive bombing was the answer. The technique gained official status in 1926 when the Navy included it in the fleet exercises. Accidents involving the bomb hitting the propeller or wheels on release, however, nearly ended its use. A solution was found in a bomb fork, which swung the bomb clear of the propeller arc. Approval followed in 1931."

The Navy wished to replace its four main types - fighter, scout-bomber, torpedo bomber, and dive bomber - with modern all-metal monoplane aircraft. Designs by Vought, Brewster, and Northrop were chosen for further development in the dive bomber category. Brewster lacked the facilities to meet the Navy's needs and the Vought design did not have the necessary performance, although 50 would later be ordered as the SB2U Vindicator."

Chief engineer Ed Heinemann's racy low-wing monoplane design incorporated many of the revolutionary construction techniques used in the earlier aircraft. Unlike the Vought entry, the XBT-1 (as the Northrop aircraft was designated), in an effort to save weight, did not include folding wings. Split dive flaps on the trailing edge of the wing, which were perforated, eliminated tail buffeting and permitted a steeper diving angle. The Navy approved the design and ordered 54 production models designated as BT-1s."

With the switch in manufacturers the XBT-2 became the XSBD-1 (for Experimental Scout-Bomber Douglas -1). After some more minor modifications, the Navy ordered 144 SBDs in April 1939. In common with other Douglas aircraft whose names began with the letter \"D\", the SBD was named the Dauntless."

The main problem was a lack of fuel capacity, which limited the range of the Dauntless. With the amount of time spent forming up and landing on a carrier, fuel capacity was considered to be critical. Douglas agreed to address the problem, beginning with the 58th production model. The Navy agreed to accept the first 57 SBD-1s without modification and decided that the Marines, who mostly operated from land bases, could use these aircraft. The Marines, therefore, received the first Dauntlesses in June of 1940."

Fuel capacity was increased from 210 to 310 gallons and range increased to 1,200 miles. The SBD-2 also had an autopilot for the long over-water flights that were now possible. The increased weight, however, hurt performance and often one of the two .50 caliber fuselage-mounted guns would be removed to compensate. Deliveries of the SBD-2 to VS-2 and VB-2 on board the USS Lexington began in November 1940, with USS Enterprises's VS-6 and VB-6 following shortly."

At the same time, 18 Navy SBD-2s, launched from the Enterprise, which was returning to Hawaii from Wake Island, arrived just as the Japanese were attacking. Seven Dauntlesses were shot down or crash-landed. Two Japanese aircraft were claimed shot down by the Dauntlesses.

The first action took the form of hit-and-run raids by the carriers Enterprise, Lexington, and Yorktown, against remote Japanese positions in the spring of 1942. While these raids caused little damage, they served notice that the U. S. Navy was still fighting. Dauntlesses were heavily involved and attacked many ships and shore installations in these raids. One of the most famous strikes of this period was the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. An SBD reported a Japanese picket boat ahead of the task force. The Dauntless crew also reported that the boat had probably sighted them, thus precipitating the early launch of Doolittle's B-25 bombers."

The SBD-3 brought the Dauntless up to full combat standards. Self-sealing wing tanks, crew armor, and an armored windscreen were all introduced. Experience gained in the Battle of the Coral Sea prompted the introduction of twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear cockpit, thus increasing firepower. They were made standard in mid-production and earlier examples of the SBD-3 were retrofitted with the guns in the field. The added weight of these improvements was offset to a certain extent by the use of alclad to replace the dural skin of the earlier models, and the removal of the flotation equipment that was standard on the SBD-2. Maximum speed fell by a small margin to 250 mph, earning this model the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \" The Speedy Three\". Service ceiling, however, improved from 26,000 to 27,100 ft."

The plan was to gain a base from where they could threaten the Hawaiian Islands and thus draw the remaining U.S. carriers out to be destroyed in a major fleet engagement. The U.S. Navy had an advantage in that they had broken the Japanese code and knew the attack was coming. Also, the Japanese did not realize that Yorktown, which had been damaged (and believed sunk) at Coral Sea, had been hastily repaired and was able to join Enterprise and Hornet at Midway. The three U.S. carriers carried 112 Dauntlesses. Most were the latest model, but a few SBD-1s and -2s were also aboard. While the Japanese had a much larger fleet, the sides were more evenly matched in the crucial area of airpower. The Japanese had four aircraft carriers, and the U.S. had three carriers and the land-based aircraft at Midway, which included 19 SBD-2s."

Meanwhile, a PBY Catalina had spotted the Japanese fleet and the U.S. carriers began to launch their aircraft. Because of the varying launch times and speeds of the different aircraft, the TBD torpedo planes were the first to attack the Japanese carriers. The slow Devastators were easy targets for the Japanese fighters and were soon beaten back with no damage to the carriers. Because of the uncoordinated nature of the attack, the SBD squadrons had trouble finding the carriers. The Hornet SBD's never found the carriers. Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, the Commander of the Enterprise's Air Group, however, made a navigational guess that brought his VS-6 and VB-6 right over the Japanese carriers. The attacking TBDs had drawn down the Japanese fighter screen and the Dauntlesses found the targets wide open. Japanese indecision as to whether to launch further strikes on the island or to attack the recently discovered American carriers, left bombs and torpedoes, along with aviation fuel, scattered on the carriers' decks. At the same time as McClusky's group attacked, VB-3 from Yorktown arrived. The combined onslaught rained 39 bombs on three Japanese carriers in three to four minutes, and 11 direct hits mortally damaged the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. The fourth carrier, Hiryu, was located later and was also sunk by Dauntlesses. Japan lost four carriers and many of its experienced aviators for the loss of 35 Dauntlesses from the six Navy and one Marine SBD squadrons engaged. The SBD had stopped the Japanese and allowed the U.S. to fight on an equal footing in the Pacific."

In contrast with the naval actions of the Pacific, SBD attacks were mostly against ground targets in support of the Allied landings. They were, however, called upon to attack seven Vichy French cruisers that set out to attack the Allied troopships. On November 10, nine SBDs from the Ranger sank the moored battleship Jean Bart which had been firing on the invasion fleet.

But, at 245 mph maximum speed, this was also the slowest version. Early in 1943 the SBD-5, with a larger engine, started to enter squadron service. Two additions that increased bombing accuracy were the replacement of the telescopic sight of the early models with a reflector sight and a heated windscreen, which overcame the fogging that had been common in the dive run. Radar was also more commonly seen on this model. The additional weight of the extra equipment, however, largely cancelled out the increased horsepower."

Its role on the new carriers changed however. The new CVs could carry 100 airplanes, compared to 80 on the older carriers, and the scout squadrons were eliminated. The difference in airplanes was made up by an increase in the numbers of fighters. Scout duties were now taken over by the Hellcats and Avengers, both of which had long range capabilities. From then on, Dauntlesses would serve almost exclusively as strike aircraft. SBDs continued to fly throughout 1943 and not until late in the year did the SB2C Helldiver finally enter service. Many navy pilots did not see the Helldiver as much of an improvement over the Dauntless. Pilots preferred the SBD's more responsive controls which made it an easy plane to fly when lightly loaded. The Douglas aircraft also required less maintenance hours than did the Curtiss."

The Navy initially ordered 179 N3N-1 models, and the factory began producing more than 800 N3N-3 models in 1938. U.S. Navy primary flight training schools used N3Ns extensively throughout World War II. A few of the seaplane version were retained for primary training at the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1961 they became the last biplanes retired from U.S. military service."

This aircraft was designated as the N2N and would be similar to the Consolidated NY-2s and NY-3s still in service. Following the production of this aircraft through 1929, the Navy requirement for a new primary flight traininer for the 1930s prompted the development of an important series of biplanes that served from 1938 through World War II. The N3N model, manufactured by the Navy Aircraft Factory (NAF) in Philadelphia answered the need. The N3N was used extensively as the primary trainer until the end of WWII. Outwardly, this aircraft appeared similar to the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3. The major difference in the N3N was its structure, which featured riveted extruded aluminum fuselage construction with removable side panels for ease of inspection and maintenance. The wings, also constructed internally of all metal, were covered with fabric like the fuselage and tail."

The prototype, US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) Number 9991, went through service trials during February and March 1936. The trials recommended minor modifications, leading to the creation of another version, the XN3N-2. The NAF built one hundred and seventy-nine N3N-1s, with the first one delivered in June 1936. A fourth N3N-1 (BuAer # 0020) was modified as another prototype, XN3N-3. These two aircraft were fitted with navy built versions of the 240 hp Wright J-6-7 (R-760-96) engine, which was the same as that used in the NY-3s since 1929. The N3N-3, of which 816 were built, differed slightly from the -1. It had a redesigned vertical tail and a single strut landing gear. The N3N-1 was produced with a distinctive anti-drag ring around the engine, but the N3N-3s did not have this feature."

Landings were best-done using the full-stall technique. The N3N was flown over the fence at about 57-60 knots (65-70 mph) and stalled at 44 knots (50 mph) with a full load. Visibility was better from the back seat for landing. Cockpit instrumentation consisted of an altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, compass, turn and bank indicator, and a combination fuel and oil temperature and pressure gauge. The aircraft could climb at 900 feet per minute and cruise at 87 knots (100 mph), at 1800 rpm. Climbing and gliding were accomplished at 65 knots. The aircraft's service ceiling was 15,200 feet (4,632 m). The N3N's great structural integrity allowed for high G turns and pullouts at close to 174 knots (200 mph)."

The C.F. was only the beginning for Giuseppe Bellanca who improved the design and created an entire line of successful cabin monoplanes including the famous WB-2 Columbia, and Bellanca Pacemakers, Skyrockets, and Cruisairs for sport and executive flying. Bellanca introduced the C.F., though, before the government authorized private airmail contracts and instituted the initiatives and regulations that would bring about the rise of the commercial aircraft industry. Thus, it was the Bellanca C.F.'s fate to be ahead of its time."

Bellanca had built two airplanes in his native Sicily before constructing a Parasol, a small tractor monoplane with a parasol wing, 30 horsepower Anzani engine and a simple open framework with a seat on the lower longeron, in the back of his brother's grocery store in Brooklyn in 1911. He then proceeded to test fly the aircraft, while at the same time, teaching himself how to fly. After the formation of the school and construction of another aircraft, Bellanca began instructing from the ground as students experimented with short hops in the single-seat aircraft. One of his early students was Fiorello LaGuardia, later a World War I bomber pilot and mayor of New York City, who offered to teach Bellanca to drive a Model T Ford in return."

The C.E. soon followed quickly with ailerons and a radial Anzani engine that produced a maximum speed of 102 mph and was purchased by Clarence Chamberlain as a barnstorming aircraft. Lured to Omaha, Nebraska, by a short-lived business proposition, Bellanca then formed the Roos-Bellanca Aircraft Company with Victor H. Roos and A.H. Fetters to complete the in-progress Bellanca C.F."

The fuselage had a hump shape, similar to an airfoil that required the pilot, sitting aft of the cabin and off center to the left, to look under the left wing of the aircraft for side and some forward visibility. The struts of the aircraft were also airfoil shape and thus assisted with lift in flight, rather than just supporting the high single wing. Balsa wood, for lightness, formed the leading edge of the two-spar strut. The wooden-frame fuselage was covered with mahogany plywood panels around the cabin and tail area and with fabric on the aft fuselage and on the wings, struts, and flying tail surfaces. The cabin accommodated four passengers and had five small windows on each side. The aircraft was powered by a 95 hp Anzani engine. Harry G. Smith, an airmail pilot, took the C.F. up for its first flight on June 8, 1922, and he reported the aircraft's favorable stability and maneuverability in banking, loops and rolls."

Bellanca did so by entering the C.F. in several races with dramatic results. One week after its first flight, the Bellanca C.F. flew at the Midwestern Flying Meet at Monmouth, Illinois, where it won all four events of speed, time to climb, and gliding endurance. Wins at the Tarkio Aero Meet, Interstate Aero Meets, with famed airmail pilot Bill Hobson as pilot, and the National Air Races of 1923, plus two aerial marriages performed in the cabin, garnered publicity for the C.F. and its performance."

The Yellow Aircab Company of New York purchased the C.F. in 1924, with plans for an aerial taxi service, and added a 110 hp Anzani engine along with a new forward fuselage, a steel-tube landing gear, and more windows in the fuselage. Yellow Aircab went out of business and Continental Aircraft Corporation bought the aircraft in 1925, but it too went bankrupt. P. Bilbertis bought the aircraft on August 30, 1928, and sold it on December 10 to William Stanley Smith for only $150.00. Smith acquired registration number NR11036 for the aircraft, a restricted license because he was a student pilot, and installed first a 35-gallon and then a 55-gallon fuel tank. He also added a vertical stabilizer to the tail. Instructor pilot Paul Kotze was ready to test-fly the aircraft on a marginal day of high winds and low ceilings but veteran pilot Bert Acosta arrived and announced his intention to fly the airplane because it was the one type that he had never flown. Acosta flew above the clouds for awhile and then landed and apologized for commandeering the aircraft."

The Roosevelt Field Museum deteriorated and the C.F. returned to the Bellanca family, then living on the Sassafras River near the Chesapeake Bay, in Galena, Maryland. After Giuseppe's death in 1960, the family donated the aircraft to the Museum, and it arrived at the Silver Hill facility in Suitland, Maryland. From January 1979 to May 1980, NASM craftsmen repaired, replaced, or rebuilt significant portions of the aircraft, including the mahogany fuselage, tail section, landing gear, and engine mount and cowling. New Grade A cotton fabric and a restored 110 hp Anzani engine completed the restoration."

After honing his skills as a pilot and an airplane builder with several other aircraft (possibly as many as four), he built the flying boat in the NASM collection probably in 1912 or early 1913. Ecker patterned his airplane closely after the highly successful Curtiss Model E and F flying boats. By 1912, Ecker was taking passengers aloft and doing exhibitions at fairs and other public gatherings. Some of this exhibition flying was certainly done with the aircraft in the NASM collection, but exactly when and where is unknown. Despite the similarity in general appearance with the commercially produced Curtiss flying boat, the Ecker airplane bears the hallmarks of a lone builder, long on enthusiasm and ingenuity, but short on resources and access to the latest technology."

                "content": "Most of the aircraft in the National Air and Space Museum collection achieved fame in their own right or represent an important aircraft type of technical or historical significance. The Ecker Flying Boat adequately meets these criteria, but it deserves a place in the national collection for another equally noteworthy reason. The Ecker represents that vast, largely unknown, wholly uncelebrated population of pioneer aviators who built flying machines in their backyards out of bits and scraps from the local hardware store. Their efforts helped to carry the burgeoning technology of heavier-than-air flight out of infancy."

Ecker, a native of Syracuse, New York, was gripped and inspired by the excitement of the daring displays put on by the acclaimed aviators of his day such as the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss. He soon joined the growing ranks of early pilots himself, learning to fly at Belmont Park, New York, most likely in 1911. After honing his skills as a pilot and an airplane builder with several other aircraft (possibly as many as four), Ecker built the flying boat now in the NASM collection probably in 1912 or early 1913. The exact date of construction is uncertain, as are many of the details regarding his flying activities and his aircraft."

This sufficed on clear days, but when it rained the water-soluble glue dissolved. Ecker dealt with this problem by applying a coat of varnish over the glue. The spruce wing structure was simple, with little internal bracing, even by 1912 standards. Basic aircraft hardware was largely improvised. Strut fittings were hand-made from sheet steel, and the turnbuckles used to put tension in the bracing and control wires were refashioned motorcycle spokes."

He removed several unnecessary components to save weight and added an automobile radiator for cooling. Later a second radiator was fitted to cure continual overheating problems. Two carburetors fed fuel into a unique rotary-valve intake that in turn redistributed the fuel to the individual cylinders. It generated between 50 and 65 horsepower. The six-gallon fuel capacity provided for twenty to thirty minutes of flying time. The engine had no exhaust pipe. Hot exhaust simply spewed out of each cylinder under the wing, requiring a protective aluminum sheath on the upper center-section fabric. There were no engine instruments; all adjustments were made by judgement according to the sound of the engine."

Initially it was fitted with a wheeled landing gear. Later, pontoons replaced the wheels to allow flying off water. In its final and present form, the Ecker features an actual boat hull made of spruce, oak, and ash, sealed internally with oil and externally with a hand-rubbed gray enamel finish. The hull reportedly had wheeled beaching gear to move the aircraft from water to land and vice versa, but no information on the size and style of the wheels exists."

By the time the aircraft in the NASM collection took to the air, Ecker had built a modest local reputation as a pilot and an exhibition flyer in his home territory of western New York State. In a pontoon-fitted hydro-aeroplane (possibly an earlier configuration of the NASM aircraft), Ecker was the first to fly in his home town of Syracuse, New York, making a successful takeoff from nearby Onondaga Lake in 1911. By 1912, he was taking passengers aloft and doing exhibitions at fairs and other public gatherings. Some of this exhibition flying was certainly done with the aircraft in the NASM collection, but exactly when and where or in which of its many configurations the airplane appeared is unknown. The only direct reference to the flight history of this airplane is a vague statement made by Ecker in a 1930s newspaper interview in which he said he flew it extensively for a period of three years and then placed it in storage. The Ecker Flying Boat emerged one more time before it came to NASM when it was displayed at the 1930 New York State Fair."

The components of the now ancient flying boat were gingerly hoisted out of a fourth floor window and transported to the home of the proud new owner, Owen Billman, to await restoration. Before long, news of the find reached the airplane's original builder and pilot, Herman Ecker, who was by then living out a happy retirement in Florida. Ecker prevailed upon the discoverer of his long-lost flying boat to donate the airplane to the Smithsonian Institution. In 1961 the Ecker arrived at NASM and was stored until its restoration in 1981-1982."

Design of the Merlin began in 1933 following the similar Kestrel design. Early Merlin Mk II and Mk III engines, which produced about 7,457 kw (1,000 horsepower), powered Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. Engine improvements and progress in supercharger performance increased the Merlin's rated power to over 1,715 kW (2,300 horsepower) by the end of the war."

U.S. Packard-built Merlin 100s (V-1650-9 and -11) powered later versions of the North American Mustang."

The technique called for two molded plywood half-shells that were glued together around wooden hoops or stringers. But to construct the half shells, rather than gluing many strips of plywood over a form, three sets of spruce strips were soaked with glue and laid in a semi-circular concrete mold that looked like a bathtub. This process reduced the time needed from several days down to about 20 minutes. Then, under a tightly clamped lid, a rubber balloon was inflated in the cavity to press the plywood against the mold. Twenty-four hours later, the smooth half-shell was ready to be joined to another to create the fuselage. The two halves were each less than a quarter inch thick."

After completing its initial test flights in 1959, the X-15 became the first winged aircraft to attain velocities of Mach 4, 5, and 6 (four, five, and six times the speed of sound). Because of its high-speed capability, the X-15 had to be designed to withstand aerodynamic temperatures on the order of 1,200 degrees F.; as a result, the aircraft was fabricated using a special high-strength nickel alloy named Inconel X."

Indeed, the X-15 design was so much like that of a space vehicle that during the formative days of Project Mercury, America\u2019s first attempt to put a man in orbit, North American and National Air and Space Administration (NASA) engineers gave serious consideration to utilizing a growth version of the X-15 for the manned orbiting mission. This plan was dropped in favor of using a blunt-body reentry vehicle. Because of the potential dangers to the pilot should the X-15\u2019s pressurized cockpit lose its atmosphere while the aircraft operated in a near-space environment, X-15 pilots wore specially developed full-pressure protection \u2018spacesuits\u2019 while flying the experimental plane."

The X15 #2 (56-6671) was rebuilt following a landing accident as the advanced X-15A-2, having increased propellant capacity and, hence, a higher potential performance. The X-15A-2 was the fastest X-15 flown, and it is now on exhibit at the Air Force Museum, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The X-15 #3 (56-6672) featured an advanced cockpit display panel and a special adaptive control system. The aircraft made many noteworthy flights until it crashed during atmospheric reentry, following pilot disorientation and a control-system failure. The pilot, Capt. Michael Adams, was killed."

Various proposals were set forth for modifying the aircraft to accomplish new and even more radical tasks. At one point, NASA scientists planned to test a hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustion ramjet engine mounted on the X-15s lower vertical fin. A mock-up of this proposed installation was flight-tested on the X-15A-2. Other ideas included modifying the X-15 with a slender delta wing and using the aircraft as a booster for small satellite launch vehicles. None of these ideas, however, came to fruition."

North American was selected as prime contractor on the project following a competition in which Douglas. Republic. and Bell also participated. By the time of its first airborne test, flight research was too complex to rely on simple air-to-ground communications near a test field. The Air Force and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics developed a special 485-mile-long test corridor stretching from Wendover Air Force Base. Utah. to Edwards Air Force Base. California. It was planned that the X15 would be air-launched from a Boeing B-52 near Wendover. then fly down this corridor, the High Range. to Edwards. monitored by tracking stations at Ely and Beatty. Nevada. and at Edwards. The range lay along a series of flat dry lakes. where the X-15 could make an emergency landing. if necessary. Nothing this extensive had previously existed in flight research, and it foreshadowed the worldwide tracking network developed by American manned spacecraft ventures. The X-15 would complete its research mission and then. followed by special Lockheed F-104 chase aircraft. would land on the hard clay of Rogers (formerly Muroc) Dry Lake. Because the X-15 featured a cruciform tail surface arrangement. it was necessary for the designers to make the lower half of the ventral fin jettisonable prior to landing so that the conventional two-wheel, nose-landing gear and two tail-mounted landing skids could support the aircraft."

The booster was to quickly get the missile up to supersonic speed for its ramjets to operate. Each chamber produced 120,000 pounds of thrust, or 240,000 pounds total, using kerosene and liquid oxygen as propellants."

This object was donated to the Smithsonian in 1970 by Rocketdyne."

It was the single-seat version of the B\u00fc-131A Jungmann, a two-place advanced aerobatic sport and training plane introduced in 1934 by B\u00fccker Flugzeugbau in Berlin. The Jungmann became popular with the flying schools of Luftsportverband, a civil flying association during the early 1930s before military flight was allowed in Germany. In reality, the association trained the pilots who formed a clandestine air arm that later became the Luftwaffe. In 1935, Carl B\u00fccker introduced the single seat Jungmeister, so similar to the Jungman that parts could be interchanged. While the Jungmeister was designed to use either the Hirth HM 506 160-hp inline air-cooled engine or the seven-cylinder radial air-cooled Siemens Sh-14A of 160 hp, the latter engine was used almost exclusively. The fuselage was a steel tube covered with fabric, and the wings were built of wooden spars and ribs with fabric cover, with the upper and lower panels being interchangeable. The outer wing panels had an 11-degree sweep-back."

                "content": "Because of its agility and lightness on the controls, it was selected by a number of European flying clubs and air services as an advance trainer for aerobatics. Some pilots of the prewar era contend that the only aircraft that matched the Jungmeister were the specially built Great Lakes trainers, but others even question this comparison. A number of Jungmeisters still exist, both here and in Europe, and command high prices because of their scarcity and demonstrated maneuverability. After World War II, a limited number of the airplanes were produced near Munich, but high labor costs made them almost prohibitively expensive. This situation and the growing enthusiasm for aerobatic flying led to the development of rival types such as the Pitts Special, the Zlin 526A Trener Master, and the Yak 18 PS."

Aerobatic pilot Alex Papana acquired the aircraft and it shipped to the United States in 1936 aboard the airship Hindenburg. During the Cleveland Air Races of 1937, both Papana and Count Hagenburg flew the aircraft in competition after the latter's Jungmeister crashed while these two pilots were engaging in a showmanship contest. Papana made a low level inverted pass in front of the grandstands, and Hagenburg, not wishing to be outdone, repeated the maneuver at no more than a few feet above the ground. But as he pushed forward to climb out, the vertical fin hit the ground slowing him sufficiently to cause the plane to crash. Fortunately, Hagenburg was not injured seriously, and a few minutes later he was back in the air completing his performance in Papana's Jungmeister."

He rebuilt it with a Warner engine and flew it to victory again in 1940. Beverly \"Bevo\" Howard soon bought the Jungmeister and won the 1946 and 1947 aerobatic championships with it. Howard took great pleasure in flying numerous weekend air shows and programs for worthy causes, and he always performed at the graduation ceremonies for aviation cadets at Hawthorne Aviation Company Schools, of which he was president, in Charleston, South Carolina. Unfortunately, on October 17, 1971, while flying at a show in Greenville, North Carolina, he had a fatal accident. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) cited complete engine failure, fuel exhaustion and failure to see and avoid objects and obstructions (a tree) as the probable causes. The Jungmeister was almost demolished but was rebuilt by his estate and friends who had worked with him during its flying career."

One time barnstormers, the brothers designed and were attempting to market a two-seat monoplane called the Chummy, when Gordon Taylor was killed in a crash. Gilbert Taylor, who believed that there would be a growing market for light planes, moved in 1929 to Bradford, Pennsylvania, where community leaders were anxious to promote new local industries. The Bradford Board of Commerce provided $50,000 to capitalize the new Taylor Company, which built five Chummys before the Great Depression put a halt to construction."

Being interested in aviation and believing that the Chummy was too expensive and inefficient, Piper offered to sponsor the development of a small plane to sell for half the Chummy's $3,985. The resulting aircraft, designated the E-2, was completed in late 1930, and fitted with a two-cylinder Brownbach \"Tiger Kitten\" engine. Testing had revealed the Tiger Kitten, which was rated at 20 hp, had too little power for the E-2. At full throttle, the small airplane was able only to indulge in 'grass cutting,\" rising a few feet into the air before settling back to earth. However, it motivated Taylor's accountant to observe that an airplane with a kitten engine should be known as a cub, and a legend was born."

The aircraft received a Continental A-40 engine and became the Taylor E-2, resulting in sales of more than 300. Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle-deck and fairing it into the trailing edge of the wing; he also rounded the wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the break down of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in December 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. Taylor J-2s were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937. Piper moved the company to an old silk factory in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and began production again in July. In November Piper changed the company name to Piper Aircraft Company and the first Piper J-2 Cub, serial number 1937 (also in NASM's collection), rolled off the line. In all 1,547 E-2/J-2 Cubs were built from February 1931 through May of 1938."

Brakes were soon added too. Powered by 40-hp Continental, Lycoming, or Franklin engines, the J-3 sold for $1,300. Engine horsepower was soon raised to fifty and reached sixty-five by 1940. Piper also standardized the color scheme to Lock Haven Yellow, an orange-yellow later replaced by the lighter Piper Cub yellow with black trim."

Seventy-five percent of all pilots in the CPTP were trained on Cubs, many going on to more advanced training in the military."

The J-3 is now finding an ever-increasing popularity among antique airplane owners, and brand new Cubs are being constructed by homebuilders. Both an excellent trainer and a delightful sport plane, it lends itself to lazy summer afternoons. The Cub might best be summed up by the words \"simple\" \"economical\" and above all, \"slow.\""

It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and the ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface."

Gilbert and Gordon Taylor founded the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Company of Rochester, New York, and built the A-2 Chummy, a small parasol-wing, side-by-side, open-cockpit aircraft. Gordon Taylor was killed in a crash and C.G. moved to Bradford, Pennsylvania, encouraged by the promise of financial assistance for his company. William T. Piper and other local oilmen provided capital for Taylor to redesign the high-priced ($3,985) Chummy, into a low-cost, high-wing tandem aircraft with side panels and a door. The 20 hp Brownback Tiger Kitten engine barely powered the aircraft off the ground, but, it motivated Taylor's accountant to observe that an airplane with a kitten engine should be known as a cub, and a legend was born."

The aircraft received a Continental A-40 engine and became the Taylor E-2, resulting in sales of more than 300. Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle deck and fairing it into the trainling edge of the wing; he also rounded wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the breakdown of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. About 695 Taylor J-2s Piper were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937. Piper moved the company to an old silk factory in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and began production again in July. By November the aircraft name changed to Piper. In all 1,547 E-2/J-2 Cubs were built from February 1931 through May of 1938."

A succession of owners included Lee Fahringer, Clayton Miller, Eugene Smith, HRB-Singer, Inc. of State College, and Robert Dunlap. Hal Goff, of Aero Enterprises in Pittsburgh, found the airplane in a hangar in West Virginia and restored it to flyable condition. He flew it to Lock Haven in 1976 where it generated great interest at the roll-out ceremony of the 100,000th Piper aircraft, a Cheyenne. While there Walt Jamoneau and astronaut Pete Conrad flew the aircraft. W. C. Connell, of Pensacola, Florida, acquired it by 1979 and sold it to Lefferts Mabie, Jr. of Pensacola, late in November 1984. Mabie donated it to the Museum in December 1984."

It is the fastest aircraft propelled by air-breathing engines. The Blackbird's performance and operational achievements placed it at the pinnacle of aviation technology developments during the Cold War. The airplane was conceived when tensions with communist Eastern Europe reached levels approaching a full-blown crisis in the mid-1950s. U.S. military commanders desperately needed accurate assessments of Soviet worldwide military deployments, particularly near the Iron Curtain. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's subsonic U-2 (see NASM collection) reconnaissance aircraft was an able platform but the U. S. Air Force recognized that this relatively slow aircraft was already vulnerable to Soviet interceptors. They also understood that the rapid development of surface-to-air missile systems could put U-2 pilots at grave risk. The danger proved reality when a U-2 was shot down by a surface to air missile over the Soviet Union in 1960."

This proved to be impracticable because of considerable fuel consumption. Lockheed then reconfigured the design for conventional fuels. This was feasible and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), already flying the Lockheed U-2, issued a production contract for an aircraft designated the A-12. Lockheed's clandestine 'Skunk Works' division (headed by the gifted design engineer Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson) designed the A-12 to cruise at Mach 3.2 and fly well above 18,288 m (60,000 feet). To meet these challenging requirements, Lockheed engineers overcame many daunting technical challenges. Flying more than three times the speed of sound generates 316\u00b0 C (600\u00b0 F) temperatures on external aircraft surfaces, which are enough to melt conventional aluminum airframes. The design team chose to make the jet's external skin of titanium alloy to which shielded the internal aluminum airframe. Two conventional, but very powerful, afterburning turbine engines propelled this remarkable aircraft. These power plants had to operate across a huge speed envelope in flight, from a takeoff speed of 334 kph (207 mph) to more than 3,540 kph (2,200 mph). To prevent supersonic shock waves from moving inside the engine intake causing flameouts, Johnson's team had to design a complex air intake and bypass system for the engines."

Lockheed hoped to achieve this by carefully shaping the airframe to reflect as little transmitted radar energy (radio waves) as possible, and by application of special paint designed to absorb, rather than reflect, those waves. This treatment became one of the first applications of stealth technology, but it never completely met the design goals."

A-12s, flown by CIA pilots, operated as part of the Air Force's 1129th Special Activities Squadron under the \"Oxcart\" program. While Lockheed continued to refine the A-12, the U. S. Air Force ordered an interceptor version of the aircraft designated the YF-12A. The Skunk Works, however, proposed a \"specific mission\" version configured to conduct post-nuclear strike reconnaissance. This system evolved into the USAF's familiar SR-71."

The modified A-12s were redesignated M-21s. These were designed to take off with the D-21 drone, powered by a Marquart ramjet engine mounted on a pylon between the rudders. The M-21 then hauled the drone aloft and launched it at speeds high enough to ignite the drone's ramjet motor. Lockheed also built three YF-12As but this type never went into production. Two of the YF-12As crashed during testing. Only one survives and is on display at the USAF Museum in Dayton, Ohio. The aft section of one of the \"written off\" YF-12As which was later used along with an SR-71A static test airframe to manufacture the sole SR-71C trainer. One SR-71 was lent to NASA and designated YF-12C. Including the SR-71C and two SR-71B pilot trainers, Lockheed constructed thirty-two Blackbirds. The first SR-71 flew on December 22, 1964. Because of extreme operational costs, military strategists decided that the more capable USAF SR-71s should replace the CIA's A-12s. These were retired in 1968 after only one year of operational missions, mostly over southeast Asia. The Air Force's 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (part of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing) took over the missions, flying the SR-71 beginning in the spring of 1968."

This equipment included a sophisticated Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) system that could jam most acquisition and targeting radar. In addition to an array of advanced, high-resolution cameras, the aircraft could also carry equipment designed to record the strength, frequency, and wavelength of signals emitted by communications and sensor devices such as radar. The SR-71 was designed to fly deep into hostile territory, avoiding interception with its tremendous speed and high altitude. It could operate safely at a maximum speed of Mach 3.3 at an altitude more than sixteen miles, or 25,908 m (85,000 ft), above the earth. The crew had to wear pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts. These suits were required to protect the crew in the event of sudden cabin pressure loss while at operating altitudes."

While this would appear to dictate high fuel flows, the Blackbird actually achieved its best \"gas mileage,\" in terms of air nautical miles per pound of fuel burned, during the Mach 3+ cruise. A typical Blackbird reconnaissance flight might require several aerial refueling operations from an airborne tanker. Each time the SR-71 refueled, the crew had to descend to the tanker's altitude, usually about 6,000 m to 9,000 m (20,000 to 30,000 ft), and slow the airplane to subsonic speeds. As velocity decreased, so did frictional heat. This cooling effect caused the aircraft's skin panels to shrink considerably, and those covering the fuel tanks contracted so much that fuel leaked, forming a distinctive vapor trail as the tanker topped off the Blackbird. As soon as the tanks were filled, the jet's crew disconnected from the tanker, relit the afterburners, and again climbed to high altitude."

Shortly after deliveries to front-line squadrons of the Camel began, Sopwith designed a new single-seat fighter called the Snipe. The new airplane was simply intended to be a derivation of the Camel, with improved visibility for the pilot, and gentler handling qualities, more reminiscent of the earlier Sopwith Pup. After nearly a year in development, the new fighter went into production in spring 1918, and the first examples arrived in squadron service on August 30 of that year."

Shortly after deliveries to front-line squadrons of the Camel began, Sopwith designed a new single-seat fighter called the Snipe. The new airplane was simply intended to be a derivation of the Camel, with improved visibility for the pilot, and gentler handling qualities, more reminiscent of the earlier Sopwith Pup. It was not a radically different aircraft. Also in the spring of 1917, Britain's Air Board issued general specifications for future military aircraft designs. During the testing of six Snipe prototypes in the summer of 1917, modifications were made to bring the new Sopwith design in line with the Air Board's specifications. The most notable change was the expansion of the biplane wing cell to two bays instead of the typical single-bay configuration. By early 1918, the Air Board issued yet another set of aircraft specifications, referred to as Type I-Single-seat fighter (high altitude). The Snipe and three other new designs, the Austin Triplane, the Boulton & Paul Bobolink, and the Nieuport B.N.1, all intended to be powered by the new Bentley B.R.2 rotary engine, competed in Type I acceptance trials in February 1918. The four aircraft were judged to be generally similar in performance, and none was considered especially impressive. The Snipe was ultimately selected because it was thought the least undesirable overall, and because it incorporated many standard Sopwith components and its structural design was the least radical-features that increased its potential for rapid production and deployment. After nearly a year in development, the new fighter went into production in spring 1918, and the first examples arrived in squadron service on August 30 of that year."

Oliver Stewart, an experienced test pilot who flew all Sopwith's wartime aircraft, expressed the differences thus: \"It [the Snipe] was, \u2026, soberer and more dignified. It was more powerful and it had better all-round performance, but it had none of the qualities of lightning maneuver of the Camel. To turn from a Camel to a Snipe was like turning from an eight-horsepower sports car to an eight-ton lorry. The lorry is the more powerful, and it carries more and is bigger; the eight horsepower sports car is lighter and more responsive.\""

With the creation of the Royal Air Force in April 1918, it became the first fighter of the newly established unit of the British armed forces. But it arrived too late to have any significant operational impact. After the war, the Snipe became the standard R.A.F. night fighter. The cessation of hostilities caused a dramatic downturn in new aircraft development, thereby extending the operational life of the Snipe in postwar R.A.F. units; but by the mid-1920s no Snipes remained in active service."

                "content": "The Sopwith Snipe in the NASM collection was built in August 1918. The original owner of record in the United States was Arthur Le Barron, possibly the importer of the airplane. It was sold to Leo Langevin from Binghamton, N.Y., who applied for registration in 1928. He refurbished the Snipe with new fabric covering, refinishing of the wood, and the mounting of a 130-horsepower Clerget engine. Langevin sold the airplane to Myron A. \"Jimmy\" Romberger of Endicott, N.Y., in September 1930. Romberger converted the Snipe into a two-place airplane and in August 1932 sold it to Roosevelt Field, Inc., Mineola, N.Y., which placed it in the aviation museum at Roosevelt Field. It was purchased by Cole Palen of Rhinebeck, N.Y., in 1951. The Snipe was among the original group of aircraft that formed the core of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome Museum collection. Palen flew the Snipe in his air shows until August 1966, when the airplane was severely damaged in a forced landing after engine trouble while piloted by Paul Richards. It was restored by Gordon Bainbridge and retired to Palen's non-flying collection. During this period, the Clerget engine was replaced with the Bentley B.R.2 that is now mounted on the airplane. Palen lent the airplane to NASM for display in the museum's new World War I aviation exhibition in 1987. The airplane was re-painted and given minor restoration treatment in preparation for installation in the exhibition, which opened to the public in 1991. The museum obtained ownership of the Snipe in 1994 as part of a bequest in Palen's will that stipulated that one aircraft from his collection should be donated to the NASM after his death."

The first was the dramatic shift from so-called \u201cmanned\u201d to Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). This shift had occurred slowly over much of the twentieth century as cruise missiles, target drones, and autopilots narrowed the role of onboard human pilots. The MQ-1 and other RPAS consist of \u201cair vehicles\u201d and ground-control equipment connected to the air vehicle by radio and satellite data links. In most RPAS, including the Predator, humans are essential to their routine operation. While no one flies on the Predator, and it often cruises under control of an autopilot, most of its functions occur at the hands of a pilot, sensor operator, and mission intelligence coordinator in the ground-control station. In this way, the Predator is more \u201cmanned\u201d than many other combat aircraft."

This encouraged development of new strategic doctrines that allowed persistent observation and aerial attack against individual targets with the same weapon system. Previously, the use of separate systems for aerial reconnaissance and for weapons delivery, often involving different military organizations, created operational and bureaucratic delays of hours, and often days, that allowed targets to escape attack or resulted in mistaken targeting. In military parlance, the Predator \u201cclosed the sensor-to-shooter cycle\u201d (i.e., the time between the identification of the target and the strike) and \u201caccelerated the kill chain.\u201d The use of the Predator as an \u201caerial sniper\u201d ushered in a new form of warfare with its own cultural and geopolitical implications."

The ability of hostile non-state organizations like Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State to base in nations ostensibly allied, or neutral, to the interests of the United States posed a significant strategic challenge during the War on Terror. Whereas airstrikes, cruise missile strikes, and special operations forces were the primary mode of American operations against terrorist organizations before 2001, they often engendered significant resistance and resentment in local populations and thus were not politically sustainable. Because Predators operated out of sight, were unmanned, and their missiles caused less unintended death and destruction than other means, the MQ-1 and its further development, the MQ-9 Reaper, operated with less political resistance than traditional forms of intervention."

By 1983, he had developed a small long-endurance tactical reconnaissance UAV prototype called the Albatross for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Five years later, further development had resulted in a more advanced design, the Amber, with a superb loitering time due to its high-aspect-ratio sailplane-like wings. A further development, the GNAT 750, resulted in a production-worthy design. Karem\u2019s company and the GNAT 750 were soon acquired by General Atomics."

The Air Force soon saw the Predator as an interim replacement for a shortfall in tactical reconnaissance aircraft with the added benefit of a live satellite video link. Authority for Predator development came under the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, nicknamed \u201cBig Safari,\u201d which had responsibility for rapid development of reconnaissance systems outside conventional \u201cmil-spec\u201d airworthiness standards, resulting in a capable, but fragile, aircraft. In the late 1990s, Big Safari expanded the Predator\u2019s capability to include a laser designator to illuminate targets and guide weapons dropped from other aircraft, reducing the sensor-to-shooter cycle. In 1999, this system had its first significant test during Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. One lesson learned was that the sensor-to-shooter cycle was still too great, as sometimes strike aircraft struggled to locate targets spotted by Predator. The solution was to explore options for arming the Predator with its own ordnance."

Given the requirement to make executive-level decisions about priority terrorist targets that might appear only briefly, the ability to watch Predator video and control the aircraft from the other side of the world in real time took on increased urgency. While Big Safari continued development in the United States, it also secretly operated several Predators from a base in Uzbekistan with the CIA during the summer and fall of 2000 to locate Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. This paid off in September, with two and possibly three successful sightings, but President Clinton\u2019s administration had not yet made a decision on direct military action against bin Laden, so the Predators soon returned to the United States. These operations also validated what would become the standard operational profile of the Predator in which a launch-and-recovery team at the operating airfield oversaw the takeoff and landing, but then passed control to a remote ground-control station via satellite, where a different crew managed the mission."

On this sortie, number 3034\u2019s crew successfully located Taliban leader Mullah Omar\u2019s convoy and maintained a firing position and requested clearance to engage. In an incident that has been highly debated ever since, authorization from the US Central Command was delayed and Omar entered a structure. Concerns about potential incidental causalities and damage led to a decision to strike a Taliban security vehicle nearby in a ploy to flush Omar out into the open. This was the first Hellfire strike from a Predator and the first successful operational use of a precision-guided UAV-delivered weapon, though other unmanned aircraft had been employed in offensive operations. During World War II, UAVs loaded with explosives were used as weapons by both the United States and Germany. The U.S. Navy employed the unmanned Interstate TDR-1 using freefall bombs against Japanese targets. At the end of the Vietnam War, the Ryan Model 147 reconnaissance drone was tested extensively with laser-guided missiles and bombs, but never reached operational status."

Between August and November 2002, during the middle of its operations from Uzbekistan, number 3034 undertook a detached deployment to another operational site where it flew thirty-two missions. This could have been either Operation Southern Focus over Iraq or deployment to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa to support a CIA surveillance program over Yemen. Given this aircraft\u2019s close association with the CIA/Big Safari program, and the timing of initial operations from Djibouti, the latter scenario is more likely. During its probable time there, a Predator Hellfire strike killed Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, who had masterminded the attack on the destroyer USS Cole. The National Air and Space Museum acquired Predator number 3034 in 2004 on the basis of its pivotal role in introducing armed RPAS into combat."

The other fifteen were Predators. Four years later, the number had tripled. Ten years after that, the US military had nearly 11,000 UAVs on inventory.

Instead, with the ability to remain airborne for up to forty hours (though operational missions rarely go much beyond twenty hours), Predator pilots and sensor operators could understand the ground situation far more clearly than in any previous aerial platform. The Hellfire missile, while powerful, also has a narrow blast effect, which made possible precision strikes that were impossible from manned aircraft. At a typical operating altitude of 15,000 feet above the terrain, the Predator was silent and invisible to those on the ground (though not stealthy to radar)."

Because the Predator bypassed the normal procurement process and did not have to meet conventional military standards for ruggedness and reliability it entered operations in something akin to a prototype phase of development. This contributed to an exceptionally high loss rate that reached 28 per 100,000 flight hours (eventually dropping to less than a quarter of that). Another concern was the \u201csoda straw\u201d effect of viewing the world through the tight focus of the camera lens and thus missing important nearby activity. This pushed investments in multiple camera array sensor systems that could monitor larger areas and use computer algorithms to highlight likely areas of concern, such as a vehicle driving in a certain manner or in the appearance of weapon system."

The Army began development of a refined derivative, the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which began operations in 2012. Even by the time of Operation Allied Force in 1999, the Air Force was aware that it needed a more capable and refined version of the Predator, so General Atomics began work on the \u201cPredator B,\u201d which entered operations in 2007 as the MQ-9 Reaper and slowly began replacing the Predator. The Reaper has twenty-five percent less endurance the MQ-1 but can carry considerably more ordnance: four Hellfire missiles and two 500-pound bombs."

For the most part, they have operated against terrorists and insurgents who lack aircraft and air defenses. However, as operations in Iraq, Syria, and Kosovo have shown, they are extremely vulnerable when opposed by a capable enemy, as they are slow and cannot maneuver aggressively. In 2002, the Air Force even adapted a Predator to carry Stinger missiles and attempted an air-to-air engagement with an Iraqi MiG-25\u2014a dogfight that resulted in the loss of the Predator."

Jamming poses a significant threat to the Predator\u2019s data links and GPS navigation, so future systems require significant advances in artificial intelligence and inertial navigation as well as faster and stealthier airframes. Another challenge is cultural\u2014who is a pilot? Initially, most RPAS pilots for the US Air Force were experienced combat pilots, but demand soon exceeded supply and the military services began training non-pilot operators. This has created organizational frictions in the military over who has the privileges of pilot status in a world where unmanned and autonomous operations are increasingly important. Regardless, the Predator and subsequent RPAS have dramatically changed the strategy and tactics of limited war in the twenty-first century."

The \"Spirit of St. Louis\" was designed by Donald Hall under the direct supervision of Charles Lindbergh. It is a highly modified version of a conventional Ryan M-2 strut-braced monoplane, powered by a reliable 223hp Wright J-5C engine. Because the fuel tanks were located ahead of the cockpit for safety in case of an accident, Lindbergh could not see directly ahead, except by using a periscope on the left side or by turning the airplane and looking out a side window. The two tubes beneath the fuselage are flare dispensers that were installed for Lindbergh's flights to Latin America and the Caribbean."

United Air Lines had ordered sixty of the new Boeing 247s, the first truly modern airliners and had effectively tied up production. The 247 carried ten passengers at 160 mph and made all other transports obsolete. The other carriers were thus forced to find another plane if they wished to be competitive in the passenger-carrying business."

The United States ordered new versions of the DC-3 modified for troop transport and cargo carrying. These were designated as C-47s and C-53s. As military versions were built, they were put into operation in European and Pacific theaters during World War II. C-47s initiated the Berlin Airlift in 1948. In military service since 1941, the C-47 proved most useful in many endeavors."

The normal range was 1,500 miles, but this could be extended by adding fuel tanks. The cruising speed varied from 155 mph to 190 mph depending on the load carried and the power used. The DC-3's safety record was better than that of most airplanes, primarily because of its great structural strength and efficient single-engine performance."

In 1931 Post and navigator Harold Gatty flew it around the world in eight days, and in 1933 Post became the first to fly around the world solo, taking only seven days. In 1935, while wearing the world's first pressure suit, which he helped design, Post flew the Vega into the stratosphere, reaching 547 kilometers (340 miles) per hour while cruising in the jet stream. The Winnie Mae was named for the daughter of F. C. Hall, the original owner and a close friend of Post."

He recognized the need to develop some means of enabling the pilot to operate in a cabin atmosphere of greater density than the outside atmospheric environment. Because of its design, the Winnie Mae could not be equipped with a pressure cabin. Post therefore asked the B. F. Goodrich Company to assist him in developing a full pressure suit for the pilot. Post hoped that by equipping the plane with an engine supercharger and a special jettisonable landing gear, and himself with a pressure suit, he could cruise for long distances at high altitude in the jetstream. On March 15, 1935, Post flew from Burbank, California, to Cleveland, Ohio, a distance of 2,035 miles, in 7 hours, 19 minutes. At times, the Winnie Mae attained a ground speed of 340 mph, indicating that the airplane was indeed operating in the jetstream."

                "content": "During its high-altitude flight research, the Winnie Mae made use of a special tubular steel landing gear developed by Lockheed engineers Clarence L. Kelly\u2019 Johnson and James Gerschler. It was released after takeoff by the pilot using a cockpit lever, thus reducing the total drag of the plane and eliminating its weight. The Winnie Mae would then continue on its flight and land on a special metal-covered spruce landing skid glued to the fuselage. During these flights, Post wore a special pressure suit, the world\u2019s first practical pressure suit and an important step on the road to space. The suit was the third type developed by Post and Russell S. Colley of B. F. Goodrich Company. It consisted of three layers: long underwear. an inner black rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer cloth contoured suit. A special pressure helmet was then bolted on the suit. It had a removable faceplate that Post could seal when he reached a height of 17,000 feet. The helmet had a special breathing oxygen system and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The suit could withstand an internal pressure of 7 psi. Bandolera-type cords prevented the helmet from rising as the suit was pressurized. A liquid oxygen container, consisting of a double-walled vacuum bottle, utilized the natural \"boil off\" tendencies of supercold liquid oxygen to furnish gaseous oxygen for suit pressurization and breathing purposes. This early full pressure suit is the direct ancestor of full pressure suits used on the X-15 research airplane and manned space voyages. The Winnie Mae, its special jettisonable landing gear, and Post\u2019s pressure suit are in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum."

On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Able and Baker (a female squirrel monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The capsule was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960."
