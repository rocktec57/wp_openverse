Kabyle women handbuild vessels of various sizes and shapes for holding water, milk and oil, for cooking and eating food and for making oil lamps.

After foreign trade routes were established, the arduous process of refining raw ores, which required large amounts of charcoal, was replaced by the less labor intensive pattern of buying iron rods and ingots of copper or brass that could be melted at the forge. At other times imported metal objects were melted down and recycled."

The vertical scarification marks on the torso of this figure identify him as one of Benin's Edo citizens. His high collar of coral beads, wide fringed anklets and broad armlets indicate he was of relatively high status. Informed members of the king's court could have deciphered this combination of details, including the rectangle held in the figure's raised hand."

From the late 15th to the early 20th century, they circulated widely, especially along the West African equatorial coast. Manillas like this one were cast in Birmingham, England, and traded as currency in West Africa. Three types of manillas exist. Pieces of the smaller standard size were often amassed and taken to a blacksmith, who melted them down and reformed into the larger size. The other two types are the so-called queen manillas and the larger specimens, or king manillas, which were considered stored wealth. Some manillas were decorated with incised designs or a second coil of metal twisted around the shank. The quality of the ringing sound and the amount of \"flash,\" or excess metal, extruded at the joints of the mold helped to determine their value. Metalsmiths from the kingdom of Benin, part of present-day Nigeria, melted down imported manillas and recast the metal into works of art."

During the 1940s and 1950s, an extensive campaign was activated to redeem all manillas still in circulation. Nevertheless, some are still found in private households to this day."

Kongo artists continued creating images of Christ, which tend to have African features, even after the missionaries departed in the mid-18th century. The cross in Kongo cosmology represents the meeting of this world and the spirit world, which may account for the continued use of the crucifix."

It is similar in form and shares iconography with other masks of this type. The cone shape relates to a special fiber cap worn by certain priests, chiefs and the king. The deadly snakes and crocodiles refer to dangerous spiritual forces that are controlled by herbalist-diviner specialists and the king. Unique to this mask are the small fish seen in relief under the lips and on the sides of the mask. They represent fish used as sacrificial offerings to the \"gods of the Benin nation\" at a palace shrine."

The detailed coral bead jewelry and the crest hairstyle identify her as an attendant to the queen mother. Once King Esigie gave his mother Idia the title of iye oba (or queen mother) in the mid-16th century, a king (or oba) could honor his mother with the title and install her in her own palace with a separate court and attendants. Upon her death, the king would commission a palace altar in her memory. This figure, which was probably intended for such an altar, depicts a member of the court-one of the attendants of graded ranks and duties who kept important people from ever being alone. The C-shaped form in her hand may be a copper or brass manilla, a type of imported currency that was the source of much of the metal used by Benin casters."

The use of surface ornament and size to indicate relative importance are in keeping with Benin court art tradition, although the result here is notably different in style from traditional Benin figures."

Its name is given to the king's senior wife, the one in charge of the women. This quality of dominance is important--in proverbs and rituals, the rooster must be mature enough to have developed spurs. It is possible rooster figures were once used on shrines dedicated to queen mothers or those queen mothers who were once senior wives, just as wood hens still appear on the altars to chiefs' mothers."

While cylindrical bracelets in ivory were reserved for the king or oba, those made of metal would have been worn by a lower-ranking chiefs when attending palace and public events. However, the presence of gilding on this example would likely have distinguished the wearer as a sub-chief of considerable importance."

                "content": "The motifs adorning this bracelet have a distinctly local symbolic value, despite the depictions of Portuguese heads that alternate with representations of intertwined mudfish. Both are Edo symbols associated with Olokun who, in the Edo pantheon, is the eldest son of the creator god Osanobua. Olokun resides in a watery realm and is associated with wealth and fertility; the oba or king is his human counterpart and a mediator between the secular and the sacred. In a 1990 publication, art historian Kathy Curnow noted that the Portuguese, who traveled by sea and brought wealth in the form of luxury trade goods, were \"a logical extension of the traditional belief system\" surrounding Olokun, \"the oba's spiritual counterpart who possessed and distributed riches.\" When rendered on plaques, bracelets, pendants and tusks, the Portuguese are usually identified by their long hair and sixteenth-century European garb, including a rounded helmet or a tall brimmed hat."

                "content": "The mudfish also depicted on this bracelet is associated with power and the watery realm of Olokun. In a 1987 publication, art historian Bryna Freyer noted that, depending on the species, a mudfish can deliver an electrical charge, walk on dry land, or survive long periods of drought by burrowing into the muddy banks of streams and rivers. It serves as an appropriate symbol for the protective, aggressive and transformative powers of the king. Freyer also noted that in juxtaposing mudfish and Portuguese imagery on plaques, armlets and pendants, Edo brasscasters employed a similar visual vocabulary in rendering the barbels, fins and tails of the fish and the mustaches, beards and hairstyles of the Portuguese, furthering strengthening their related functions as symbols relating to Olokun."

The motifs on the outer interlocking piece include kneeling hunchbacks holding tethered creatures. Hunchbacks are regarded as touched by the god Obatala who shapes the human form in the womb. White is the symbolic color of Obatala and may tie in with the use of ivory for this bracelet. The theme of ritual offerings is suggested by the disembodied heads within the interlocking circles of crocodiles biting the heads and tails of mudfish and by the tethered creatures. These creatures have been described as monkeys however they resemble Ofoe, the messenger of the god of death in the Benin Kingdom, who has no body only a head and arms and legs."

The positioning of its mouthpiece, its suspension lugs, as well as the scenes of a European hunt carved in relief and most likely based upon European prints all indicate the horn was produced for export. This horn is one of only three surviving horns attributed to the same hand. The heraldic shields and inscriptions carved near its base by this unidentified master artist help narrow the dating of its creation to between 1494 and 1500 and identify it as a royal gift from Crown Prince Manuel I of Portugal to King Ferdinand V of Castile and Aragon."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight, dated by its relatively simple large scale design and form. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges. While this weight does not have them, many early weights have incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made in the late period, like the late figurative weights they have added details and textures beyond the basic form."

Other undocumented examples, like this one, are adorned with circles, zigzags or other geometric designs. Although unusual, some headrests have animal heads projecting from either end of the curved upper platform. The heads resemble those found on troughlike containers and benches of the contemporary Dogon. This example is unusual because the platform support is hollow, like the Dogon coffers in the form of a quadruped, and instead of the dessicated grayish appearance of headrests excavated from the caves, this one has a dark brown patina. It is possible that the museum's headrest was originally made for the Tellem but reused by the Dogon."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made in the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third.

Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third.

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

Generally late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject. This object is an early-period figurative weight. These weights are relatively simple, with any decoration being large in scale and undetailed."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight, a rare ten-sided diamond form. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made in the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight with an inset copper plug. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

In the early 1600s, a Dutch report described the royal palace of the Benin court as having \"beautiful and long square galleries . . . one larger than another resting on wooden pillars . . . covered with cast copper . . . pictures of their war exploits and battles.\" Later travelers' accounts did not mention the plaques; however, the British military punitive expedition found them in a palace storehouse in 1897."

The majority of the ceramics have appeared on the market without any excavation documentation and are among the earliest known surviving artforms in sub-Saharan Africa dating from the 11th to 17th centuries. The previous owner of this work dated it from the 10th to 13th centuries. The makers were from the various peoples in the region, but it is not known whether they were men or women. Using a mixture of coarse clay and added grog (crushed pot sherds), the potters modeled the figures by hand. Most surviving examples are solid, like this example. The surface of this figure lacks the polished surface of many examples, perhaps the result of erosion."

In a letter from 1447, an Italian merchant visiting the area did remark that figures kept in sanctuaries were venerated as representing the deified ancestors of famous founding rulers of the region. This example of a figure reclining on a bed recalls funerary practices among the Senufo peoples who use wooden beds as biers in funerals."

The lack of surface decoration, the shape of the vessel and the style of the chameleons are not typical of Benin art. Although a number of unique objects emanated from the Benin court, this vessel may have been cast elsewhere or by a non-Benin artist. The technical expertise required for such a complex lost-wax casting would seem to demand the skills found in a major metalworking center. Until a more exact identification can be made, this vessel is labeled \"Lower Niger Bronze Industry,\" a term suggested by William Fagg of the British Museum in 1963 as a temporary grouping for such atypical Nigerian archaeological works."

                "content": "The eight animals on the neck of the vessel provide some information. Their four legs and curled tails, but no spots and no ears, rule out identification as leopards and suggest chameleons. The use of the chameleon in art can be documented from the western Sudan to central Africa. The lizard's ability to change color and separately rotate its eyes, as well as its slow quavering walk, are distinctive traits. In nature the chameleon's tail curls down, not up as here, but representations of spirals are important in the cosmologies of many African peoples. The spiral often refers to concepts of time and the ancestors."

                "content": "Although the Edo peoples of the Benin Kingdom credit the chameleon with magical powers, it is not a common motif in their art except on iron staffs. It symbolizes the transformative power of the diviner/healer, and its ability to change to meet any situation makes it a symbol of wisdom. The chameleon's slow gait is compared to that of an old man--one with the wisdom of age. But because the chameleon is also the spy in the magical night and is capable of such quick adaptation, it is also the nickname given to tricky and unscrupulous persons."

                "content": "To look for clues to the significance of the chameleon and this vessel, one could turn to the nearby Ijebu-Yoruba peoples, who make lidded wood boxes in the form of single chameleons. The chameleon (agemo) symbolizes the Ijebu reputation for powerful curses and medicines. The lizard's ability to transform its appearance is compared to the Ijebu peoples' history of surviving or defeating powerful enemies. The dominant cult among the Ijebu takes the name Agemo, and certain Agemo priests wear brass crowns that resemble royal beaded crowns. Although illustrated examples of these crowns do not feature chameleons, they do have the frontal faces and finial birds of Yoruba royal crowns. The grouping of the chameleons on this vessel resembles the vertical placement of birds on some Yoruba beaded crowns (including one in the museum's own collection, see 94-1-1). Agemo is a term synonymous with extraordinary leadership, and one of the followers of Oduduwa, the god who created the Yoruba kingdoms, adopted the name Agemo. Therefore, while the origin, function and meaning of this vessel are yet to be determined, its rarity, technical artistry and intriguing symbolic references make it a treasure."

In Mali, iron ore has been smelted and forged since the end of the first millennium B.C. Blacksmiths of the region still forge iron using techniques developed centuries ago. When heated, iron can be hammered into any desired shape. It hardens into a permanent form as it cools. Smiths are regarded as extraordinary for their ability to transform raw iron into tools, weapons and ritual objects."

The rider wears a hat like those worn by other important persons: hunters, ritual specialists and the praise singers or historians known as griots. The portrayal of a female rider recalls those Mande women who have acquired power and earned respect through force of character or ability as a sorcerer and are affiliated with hunters' associations. The horse suggests the powerful cavalry of the Bamana kingdoms. Such staffs were displayed on special occasions to commemorate ancestors or placed near areas sacred to initiation associations such as Jo. It was probably used as a marker for a chief's burial."

As a sheer display of wealth and power, this act would rival covering the White House with gold from Fort Knox. But more than excess, it reveals aspects of artistic technique, local history and a society in which art was essential. Today, some 900 plaques survive in public and private collections, but there is no documentation to indicate how they once were arranged. After 1700, travelers' accounts do not mention the plaques, and an 1897 British military force found them in a palace storehouse. A few plaques show narrative scenes, such as battles and hunts; some depict symbolic animals; most, like this example, have one, two or more male figures in court regalia."

                "content": "Benin art served as both a sign of status and a record of court life. The oba, nobles, officials and attendants were depicted on various objects, including plaques. Costumes and regalia indicated their relative position in the court hierarchy. The warriors on this plaque carry swords and short bows and wear headdresses made from imported horsetail. According to early accounts, horsetail headdresses symbolized military authority and were worn by war chiefs. Fanning out in low relief behind the heads, the horsetail is sculpted in a manner similar to Benin depictions of European hair or the fins and tails of the mudfish, a symbolically significant animal. Both Europeans and the mudfish are associated with Olokun, the god of the waters and bringer of wealth."

                "content": "Benin art emphasizes patterns and texture; empty space is avoided. A background pattern of quatrefoil \"river leaves\" is typical of most Benin plaques. Symbolically the background design is another reference to Olokun, who is linked with the oba and wealth, and to the oba's monopoly on foreign trade. Artistically the loose, freehand quality of the linear foliate motif contrasts with the formal pose, frontality and high relief of the figures. The well-defined musculature of the legs on this plaque is unusual and may be the style of a particular artist."

The most obvious effect of Benin's overseas trade with Europe was a dramatic increase in the availability of copper and brass. European ingots and imported metal trade goods provided the raw material that was transformed into royal Benin art by metal casters who worked solely for the oba."

Current research suggests that Owo, a Yoruba kingdom situated between the Edo kingdom at Benin City and the Yoruba capital at Ile-Ife, may have been the center of Yoruba ivory carving. Owo artists, primarily employed by their Olowo (king) but free to have other patrons, may have exported ivory carvings to other Yoruba towns, such as Oyo, and to Europe, and they may have worked as itinerant artists in such towns as Benin, where they tailored their designs to local taste."

From the mid-17th century to the first decades of the 20th century, Lemba functioned in a number of Kongo groups in central Africa. Traces of the cult have also been documented in Haiti and Brazil. Although changing over time and place, this complex cult initially focused on healing. Its members were the elite of Kongo society, those successful in the trade of European goods, slaves and copper. Only married couples could join the cult. Bracelets were exchanged and were either worn or kept wrapped in palm fronds. Owners rubbed their bracelets wtih palm oil and redwood powder."

From the mid-17th century to the first decades of the 20th century, Lemba functioned in a number of Kongo groups in central Africa. Traces of the cult have also been documented in Haiti and Brazil. Although changing over time and place, this complex cult initially focused on healing. Its members were the elite of Kongo society, those successful in the trade of European goods, slaves and copper. Only married couples could join the cult. Bracelets were exchanged and were either worn or kept wrapped in palm fronds. Owners rubbed their bracelets wtih palm oil and redwood powder."

Although 17th-century Europeans described terracottas on Kongo graves that may be linked to mabondo, more recent scholarship suggests that the form originated in the 19th century. Wealthy Kongo commissioned mabondo to commemorate the dead. They were often highly decorated with figures or incised and impressed motifs. The diamond motifs with bosses at the corners of this vessel probably represent the journey the Kongo believe humans must take when they die, traveling between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Production ceased in the 1930s."

For example, male potters sometimes handbuilt their vessels on turntables made of wood or clay. The turntable was attached to a wood plank which was fixed to the ground with a long spike or a small piece of wood, a stone or a clay pivot. Assistants turned the devices with their hands or if the edges of the turntable were serrated, the potters manipulated them with their feet. They then fired their vessels in the open."

Fired to a great hardness, the pots were covered with a saltglaze that produced a rich brown color, similar to bronze. Popular shapes included round jugs used to serve beer. The most distinctive were those with human faces on or just below the neck known as Bellarmines or Bartmann jugs. The best date from the second half of the 16th century, but they continued to be made in the 17th century and even later in some places."

In Ethiopia,18th century thaler coins from Austria were preferred. The thaler was popular because it was difficult to \"clip\" since it had writing on the side of the coin. The combination of a ruler and a crowned double eagle also appealed to local symbolism. While sometimes the coin was used directly as a pendant, more often it was melted down to fashion neck crosses, liturgical crowns and similar adornments."

The upper 4 inches curves at approximately 30 degrees. The last 3/4 inches consists of much more loosely woven fibers which form a bulb shape, probably functioning as a filter. Under the reed mouthpiece what appears to be two fibers are wrapped around the base. The preceding 8 1/8 inches consists of a singular decorative pattern. This design has a series of thin brownish fibers encircling the shaft. Running perpendicular to these are various alternating colored fibers (each 3 strands wide). The remainder of the straw consists of another decorative series. It alternates a dark brown band followed by a longer pattern of yellow/tan then orange/brown stripes. There are five of this pattern that are complete and the last one is only 1/4 as long. The filter portion at the bottom is composed of brown and orange vertical fibers woven loosely with lighter fibers woven over these and around the shaft."

Especially in eastern and southern Africa, men and women still carry snuff containers made from a variety of materials, often decorative in nature. One common choice of container is the gourd, one of the earliest cultivated plants in Africa. Once the pulp has been removed and the skin has dried and hardened, it can be embellished in a variety of ways. The most colorful is with a netting of imported glass beads. This gourd container has been totally covered in small glass beads and hung as a pendant from strands of beads."

Paired figures are thought to represent the twin spirits of Luba kingship, while a single figure or head represents a deceased king whose spirit is carried in a woman's body. This staff of office, which is decorated with a head, probably belonged to a village chief or a court dignitary among the Central Luba."

For example, he has carved a face less spherical than those found on other staffs from this area, and he has given it a small but bold chin. Behind the fillet, the plaited hair is depicted as sets of chevrons that begin at the center of the forehead, at each temple and at the nape of the neck. At the back of the head, the plaits that compose the resulting cruciform coiffure are carved in high relief, creating voids beneath them. The long neck exhibits a naturalistic detail in the laryngeal cartilage that gently projects from the throat."

A scholar and an ascetic, he criticized the corruption of both local religious leaders and the intrusive Egyptian colonial officials who governed the Sudan. Egypt was officially part of the Ottoman Empire of Turkey, but its ruling khedives (viceroys) had a great deal of autonomy and controlled the Sudan as a provincial colony. In 1882 a nationalist-driven revolt by the Egyptian army led the British to intervene and assume control in Egypt to counter what they perceived as a threat to the Suez Canal. England then found itself involved in an existing holy war in the Sudan--one that the Mahdi was winning, and would continue to win against the combined Anglo-Egyptian forces. Soon after taking the capital at Khartoum in 1885, the Mahdi fell ill and died suddenly. Khalifa Abdullah Ibn Mohamed, leader of one of the army divisions, was declared Khalifa al-Mahdi, the Madhi's successor. Under his direction, the Sudan took on more the aspect of an established administration than of a moving rebellion, a condition that prevailed until he met with a series of defeats by British Major General Sir Herbert Kitchener in the 1896-98 campaign to retake the Sudan. Khalifa al-Mahdi died in battle in 1899."

The Mahdi called his followers ansar, or helpers, after the men of Medina who supported the prophet Mohammed. They were a diverse group--desert nomads, Nile farmers, hill herders, soldiers who had been employed by slave traders and former slaves from Central Africa."

This example is particularly impressive because of its well-preserved state, vivid colors and the use of silk for the central panel. The white tube on the side would have slipped over the shaft of a spear when the banner was carried."

It was carved by an artist who lived along the Loango coast in the Congo region. Almost certainly using iron tools, he rendered with exquisite detail and lively animation a series of pictorial sequences in relief that spiral the length of the tusk. Figures in the scenes depict everyday Loango life as experienced by coastal peoples during the latter half of the 19th century."

The spiral form is an important compositional device found on horns from both traditions. In the former it has been speculated that the open spiral compositional lines allude to the path the dead follow from earth to the ancestral realm and back again as newborns. In the latter it has been suggested that the parade of figures symbolizes the long winding procession followed by both the living and the dead as they climb from the ocean to the mountains leading to the Kongo capital and the home of the ancestors."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

This object is an early period geometric weight. Most early weights are geometric with notched or indented edges, incised surfaces, punch marks and inset copper plugs. Although geometric weights were still made during the late period, figurative weights increased in both number and variety. Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other.

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third.

Generally, late-period figurative weights have added details and textures beyond the basic form that would identify the subject."

For more than five centuries, from about 1400 to 1900, Akan smiths cast weights of immense diversity. Their small size made them portable and easy to trade. Each weight was cast individually in the lost-wax method. What resulted was a unique piece, but one that had to be a specific weight to function. The shape or figure of a weight did not correspond to a set unit of measure: a porcupine in one set could equal an antelope in another, or a geometric form in a third. For important transactions, gold dust was placed on one side of a small, handheld balance scale, a weight on the other. Each party to the dealing verified the amount of gold dust using his or her own weights."

When Venice Lamb was conducting her research from 1968 to 1972, she was told that there was only one weaver in the town who remembered the twill patterns and that he was no longer able to execute them. During research as recently as 1997, however, several weavers were reported as being capable of producing Asasia. It was only commissions from the Asantehene or other entitled chiefs that were lacking. Regardless, it is evident that these are the most labor intensive weavings."

There is a particularly strong association in Ethiopia of St. George with Mary, the subject of the right panel. Mary is shown holding the Christ child and flanked by the archangels, Sts. Michael and Gabriel, with stylized blue wings. The presence of the archangels is another particularly Ethiopian addition to the standard Christian iconography. The depiction of Mary in a blue cloak with distinct folds is common. However the pose of the Christ child, grasping the hem of her garment is less typical. In most icons, He is shown making a gesture of blessing with that hand. Also Mary holds the Child with both hands, rather than holding a handkerchief in her right hand, the uniquely Ethiopian gesture found in many icons. This pose conveys a particularly human and tender image of a mother and child. Also uncommon are the small disks, held over Mary by the archangels. These do not seem to have an Ethiopian model and it has been suggested that they may relate to the Eucharist or to European communion dishes that are not used in Ethiopia but may have been depicted in an unknown prototype image."

                "content": "The practice of wearing small icons suspended from the neck in cloth or leather bags seems to date to the second half of the 15th century. They were believed to protect against evil. Later a pierced suspension cylinder would make the icons a true pendant form. While this icon has a single opening, double-sided pendants would become more common in the 17th and 18th centuries. While usually concealed by their protective wrappings, the pendant exteriors would be painted like this example or elaborately carved. The subject matter and style of the images relates to the larger panel icons. Typically Mary is shown in a blue shawl, holding a barefoot Christ child, a pose that was influenced by an Italian engraving (copied from an icon in Rome's Santa Maria Maggiore), which Jesuit missionaries introduced to Ethiopia early in the 17th century. The inclusion of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, and the juxtaposition of Mary and St. George are traditional Ethiopian additions to the iconography. The equestrian figure is one of a series of young warrior saints in Ethiopian art that are generally identified by the color of the horse. A white horse usually signifies St. George. Here the spear has a cross form finial and the serpent dragon that often appears is absent. Indeed several details commonly found have been simplified or eliminated (e.g. Christ's book, Mary's handkerchief) perhaps because of size or the inclination of the artist. The hand gesture of the Christ child, where He reaches for Mary rather than making a benediction, when combined with his gaze on her face, conveys a more tender variation on the standard pose."

He rendered with detail a series of pictorial sequences in relief that spiral the length of the tusk. Figures in the scenes depict everyday Loango life as experienced by coastal peoples during the latter half of the 19th century. Although damaged (the head of the female figure finial is broken off and missing) it has both interesting imagery that relates to trade and local traditions and a base that documents its collection history: Paymaster Geo. Kennedy U.S. Navy to Dudley Kavanagh 1863 Procured on West Coast of Africa in 1861."

The placement of Michael and Gabriel and the juxtaposition of imagery of Mary and St. George slaying a serpentlike dragon are traditional Ethiopian imagery. The elaboration of the clothing, particularly the use of patterned textiles, reflects the richness of court life and the use of Indian fabrics. The detail of Mary's white pleated cap, however, probably derives from Cretan icons."

He rendered with detail a series of pictorial sequences in relief that spiral the length of the tusk. Figures in the scenes seem to depict Loango life as a series of men posed and making culturally significant gestures. It has both interesting imagery that relates to trade and local traditions and a base that documents its collection history: Paymaster Geo. Kennedy U.S. Navy to Dudley Kavanagh 1863 Procured on West Coast of Africa in 1861."

                "content": "The rulers of the ancient Benin Kingdom exercised a monopoly over the use of copper alloy, and the majority of sculptures made of it once were displayed within the palace--atop altars, attached to piers or as regalia. Coral beads were a similar royal prerogative, worn as crown jewels and allocated to others in the court. This representation of a male head with beads totally covering the neck would seem to have a royal association, but the tight-fitting collar differs from the looser style shown on images of Benin kings. The substitution of an elaborate but unadorned hairstyle for a beaded crown also separates this individual from Benin royals. This style of head is probably a trophy head representing a powerful defeated enemy. A foreigner is suggested by the four raised scars over each eye, which are generally explained as denoting someone who is not Edo; most depictions of Edo men show three scars over each eye. This identification is in keeping with present oral tradition maintained by a chief of the Benin casters' guild, who avows that his guild cast trophy heads of the most stubborn defeated enemies. Iron inlay in the eyes and forehead signifies strength of character, just as the English clich\u00e9 \"steely eyes\" denotes determination or a \"furrowed brow\" signifies deep thought. The depiction of a worthy, yet beaten, enemy reinforces belief in the awesome magical and military powers of the Benin king. He triumphs where ordinary beings would fail."

The maker not only was adept in modeling the original form but ably constructed a mold over it that yielded a sculpture that did not require filing or post-casting repairs. This is particularly remarkable because of the high copper content of the head (tested at 94.4 percent). Copper lends itself to hammering in its pure form, but to pour and mold it easily requires alloying it with other metals."

The figure rides either an elephant or a leopard. Because neither animal was ridden in West Africa, the relationship between the figure and the animal is probably symbolic. The elephant is a metaphor for the king's strength based on the support of a broad constituency, and the leopard represents the ruler's unbridled power to administer justice, to seize what is naturally his and to protect his people."

Recent scholarship has identified the makers of the figures as the Sapi, whose present-day linguistic descendants are the Baga, Temne and Bullom. Stylistically they are similar to Sapi Portuguese ivory carvings dated to the 15th and 16th centuries. The Sapi tradition of carving stone figures probably dates at least to the 15th century. While no longer made, such figures have been found in the ground and are reused in a variety of ritual contexts by peoples in the area such as the Mende, Bullom and Kono."

Ivory represented both wealth and the power of the dangerous elephant, a royal animal. The king's ivory could be made into items of royal regalia or left whole to adorn the altars of his predecessors. Altar ivories were carved with registers of relief figures, animals and motifs. In the center of this tusk is the oba and his attendants. The oba is shown with the legs of a mudfish, emphasizing his divine powers of transformation and survival. These kinds of images conveyed a coded message that was intended more for the ancestors than for the relatively few living people who were allowed to view the altars. Some altar tusks were supported by cast copper alloy heads representing an oba."

Today over 130 similar tusks have been located by scholars in museums and private collections. According to oral tradition, the guild of ivory carvers predates the founding of the kingdom, and royal encouragement of ivory carving can be traced to the mid-15th century. Ivory tusks were noted on altars by European visitors as early as 1651, but they were probably not carved with registers of relief figures until about 1750. Some writings on Benin suggest that ivory tusks did not survive the fire of 1816, but recent research has dated approximately 20 to pre-1816. Based on motif-indexed research, this tusk is tentatively dated to the reign of oba Adolo, about 1850. Its iconography suggests use on an altar dedicated to a past oba, rather than to a queen mother or an ezomo, a major chief."

                "content": "The Ethiopian Orthodox practice of wearing small icons suspended from the neck in cloth or leather bags seems to date to the second half of the 15th century. They were believed to protect against evil. Later, a pierced suspension cylinder, as on this icon, would make these personal icons a true pendant form. Double-sided pendants would become more common in the 17th and 18th centuries. While usually concealed by their protective wrappings, the pendant exteriors would be elaborately carved like this example or more simply painted. The subject matter and style of the images relates to the larger panel icons. Typically Mary is shown in a blue shawl, holding a barefoot Christ child. The inclusion of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, and the juxtaposition of Mary and St. George are traditional Ethiopian additions to the iconography. In this example, the artist has barely alluded to the angel\u2019s wings, perhaps due partly to space constraints. The equestrian figure is one of a series of young warrior saints in Ethiopian art that are generally identified by the color of the horse. A white horse usually signifies St. George. Here the spear has a cross form finial and the dragon is shown in more serpentine form. Specialist scholars often use the presence or absence of legs on the dragon, gender on the horse and stirrups on the saddle as dating factors, although the archaizing practices of artist monks make these details unreliable. The hand gesture of the Christ child making a benediction is combined with his gaze on her face, conveying a more tender variation on the standard pose."

                "content": "Of particular interest is the iconography on the door of the reverse of the pendant depicting two standing male saints. Inscriptions especially help with identification on the larger icons, however here one saint wears a signifier. Abba Gabra Manfas Queddus (died circa 14390-33) was a monk and a hermit, his worn out ragged clothes were replaced by the growth of holy hair. Considered especially forgiving, he is venerated in Ethiopia and despite his foreign birth is a particularly Ethiopian saint. Based on other icons, his counterpart is probably Abba Ewostatewos (1273-1352) who established a monastic order in Ethiopia before leaving for Armenia in 1338 as a result of religious dispute. His followers returned and founded additional monasteries."

The potter would also be asked to make cooking pots and jars. This group of ceramic objects, produced for a special purpose and used only once, probably was assembled within the village where the funeral services were held. The female head or queen mother of another clan would prepare food in the pots. Then the figures, the food and the hearth would be moved to an area called the \"place of pots,\" a spot outside the village reserved for funerary objects. The male head of the clan would taste the food and the funeral party would return to the village, leaving the food, pots and portraits behind. Research suggests that such funerary practices, in which portrait figures played an important part, existed as early as the 17th century and lasted well into the 20th."

These works are among the earliest known surviving art forms in sub-Saharan Africa. The makers were from the various peoples in the region, but it is not known whether they were men or women. Using a mixture of coarse clay and added grog (crushed pot sherds), the potters modeled the figures by hand. Some were modeled in separate parts and fitted together. Most surviving examples are solid, but a few are hollow and built with clay coils. The surfaces are polished and covered with a red slip (clay wash). These massive works are among the largest known terracotta figures created by sub-Saharan African potters. By the 15th or 16th century, environmental and political events caused the urban centers of the Delta region to be abandoned, and the art tradition did not survive."

                "content": "Research, including local oral traditions, indicates that all ethnic groups in the Delta region used these figures. The earliest known written reference to them occurs in a letter of 1447. In it, a visiting Italian merchant remarked that the figures were kept in sanctuaries and venerated as representing the deified ancestors of famous founding rulers of the region. The elaborate dress of the figures suggests ceremonial military attire, and they may represent warriors who were once allies of the Malian emperor Sundjata Keita (c. 1210-c. 1260). Based on stylistic comparisons with similar figures, these works can be tentatively dated to between the 13th and 15th centuries."

The potter would also be asked to make cooking pots and jars. This group of ceramic objects, produced for a special purpose and used only once, probably was assembled within the village where the funeral services were held. The female head or queen mother of another clan would prepare food in the pots. Then the figures, the food and the hearth would be moved to an area called the \"place of pots,\" a spot outside the village reserved for funerary objects. The male head of the clan would taste the food, and the funeral party would return to the village, leaving the food, pots and portraits behind. Research suggests that such funerary practices, in which portrait figures played an important part, existed as early as the 17th century and lasted well into the 20th."

Recent scholarship has identified the makers of the figures as the Sapi, whose present-day linguistic descendants are the Baga, Temne and Bullom. Stylistically they are similar to Sapi Portuguese ivory carvings dated to the 15th and 16th centuries. The Sapi tradition of carving stone figures probably dates at least to the 15th century. While no longer made, such figures have been found in the ground and are reused in a variety of ritual contexts by peoples in the area such as the Mende, Bullom and Kono."

For example, the beard on this figure matches descriptions of beards among present-day inhabitants of the area, and beards often are associated with elderly men who are heads of lineages. A beard distinguishes those in authority and signals that the individual is in control. The tripod chair on which the figure leans is also significant. Temne and Bullom peoples buried important men seated in chairs."

According to one field informant, the figure is of King Bay Akiy, the fourth ruler of the Isu kingdom, who reigned in the late 18th century. Depicted returning from victory over the Nshe, a neighboring group, he is seated on a dangerous animal, probably a leopard, and holds a weapon and his enemy's head. This pose relates to a regional tradition of representing personal achievement."

The potter would also be asked to make cooking pots and jars. This group of ceramic objects, produced for a special purpose and used only once, probably was assembled within the village where the funeral services were held. The female head or queen mother of another clan would prepare food in the pots. Then the figures, the food and the hearth would be moved to an area called the \"place of pots,\" a spot outside the village reserved for funerary objects. The male head of the clan would taste the food and the funeral party would return to the village, leaving the food, pots and portraits behind. Research suggests that such funerary practices, in which portrait figures played an important part, existed as early as the 17th century and lasted well into the 20th."

The archangels, Michael and Gabriel, stand next to Mary, and Saint George often rides a white horse on the opposite panel. Small icons may have been worn around the neck suspended in cloth or leather bags or by a cord through a wood cylinder."

Brass was a port in the Niger Delta and a center for the British trade in palm oil. Its name comes from the quantities of brass that were brought in as an important trade currency and commodity. Ockiya was the head of a trading house in the mid-19th century who became so weallthy that he used the title \"king.\" So, he decided to imitate the court of the oba of Benin by commissioning figures in a more naturalistic style than traditionally used by his Ijo peoples. The style of the resulting figures may have been influenced by European ship figureheads. This figure, identified as Kagenga or Kakenga, was described as an ancestor figure. Photographs taken in 1877-1878, show the figure wearing a plant fiber skirt and a number of collar-form amulet necklaces and pendants."

Placing a crown on her head is an artistic expression of the belief in her coronation by Christ after her ascension to heaven, thereby relating it to the Assumption of Mary. However, such imagery did not become widespread until the 12th century onwards. The form of the Virgin wearing a crown only began to surface in Ethiopian art after its introduction in the 15th century--another thematic testament to its 15th century date. Images of her coronation appear later, in the early 16th century."

She is thus seen as the only human exempted from the general law of death, and a devotional icon for worshippers seeking closeness to God through her."

The potter would also be asked to make cooking pots and jars. This group of ceramic objects, produced for a special purpose and used only once, probably was assembled within the village where the funeral services were held. The female head or queen mother of another clan would prepare food in the pots. Then the figures, the food and the hearth would be moved to an area called the \"place of pots,\" a spot outside the village reserved for funerary objects. The male head of the clan would taste the food and the funeral party would return to the village, leaving the food, pots and portraits behind. Research suggests that such funerary practices, in which portrait figures played an important part, existed as early as the 17th century and lasted well into the 20th."

Trade between Benin and Portugal increased the wealth and power of the oba and his court and provided the ingots that were recast into art such as this plaque. In the early 1600s, a Dutch report described the royal palace of the Benin court as having \"beautiful and long square galleries . . . one larger than another resting on wooden pillars . . . covered with cast copper . . . pictures of their war exploits and battles.\" Later travelers' accounts did not mention the plaques; however, the British military punitive expedition found them in a palace storehouse in 1897."

These works are among the earliest known surviving art forms in sub-Saharan Africa. The makers were from the various peoples in the region, but it is not known whether they were men or women. Using a mixture of coarse clay and added grog (crushed pot sherds), the potters modeled the figures by hand. Some were modeled in separate parts and fitted together. Most surviving examples are solid, but a few are hollow and built with clay coils. The surfaces are polished and covered with a red slip (clay wash). These massive works are among the largest known terracotta figures created by sub-Saharan African potters. By the 15th or 16th century, environmental and political events caused the urban centers of the Delta region to be abandoned, and the art tradition did not survive."

The earliest known written reference to them occurs in a letter of 1447. In it, a visiting Italian merchant remarked that the figures were kept in sanctuaries and venerated as representing the deified ancestors of famous founding rulers of the region. The elaborate dress of the figures suggests ceremonial military attire, and they may represent warriors who were once allies of the Malian emperor Sundjata Keita (c. 1210-c. 1260). Based on stylistic comparisons with similar figures, these works can be tentatively dated to between the 13th and 15th centuries."

Particularly appealing are the artist's references to Ethiopian life: Mary spinning thread seated on a three-legged stool; the ball game; the style of the three yellow crowns; the lidded food basket on Salome's head; and the depiction of the Temple in Jerusalem as miniature Ethiopian churches. The hand-to-cheek pose and presence of \"Eyachem\" in the Nativity scene is more typical of Joseph. The final two scenes--the death and assumption of Mary--are rare in Ethiopian art and mix local and foreign artistic forms."

                "content": "The Ethiopian Orthodox practice of wearing small icons suspended from the neck in cloth or leather bags seems to date to the second half of the 15th century. They were believed to protect against evil. Later, a pierced suspension cylinder, as on this icon, would make these personal icons a true pendant form. Double-sided pendants would become more common in the 17th and 18th centuries. While usually concealed by their protective wrappings, the pendant exteriors would be carved like this example or more simply painted. The subject matter and style of the images relates to the larger panel icons. Typically on the first side, Mary is shown in a blue shawl, holding the Christ child. Both make gestures of blessing and the child holds a rectangular object, perhaps a book. The inclusion of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, and the juxtaposition of Mary and St. George are traditional Ethiopian additions to the iconography. On the door panel, the equestrian figure is one of a series of young warrior saints in Ethiopian art that are generally identified by the color of the horse. A white horse usually signifies St. George."

In both, however, the Western forms have been simplified to the Ethiopian mode of expression. This diptych is of the first example, which, though more rare, illustrates the impact of the expatriate European artist. Ethiopian artists-in-training preferred to copy paintings, and perhaps this diptych came from a European workshop in Ethiopia, made directly from an existing painting by Nicolo Brancaleon, as suggested by Chojnacki."
