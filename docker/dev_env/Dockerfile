# without additional configuration
# This gets chmodded with wide open permissions, so that
# on Linux hosts, the explicitly passed user (with docker group)
# is able to read/write from here, as well as the root user used by
# macOS hosts (who don't have Docker permissions or host filesystem
# permissions issues to contend with and as such run the container as root)

# Dependency explanations:
# - git: required by some python package; contributors should use git on their host
# - perl: used in linting
# - gcc, g++: required by some pre-commit hooks for node-gyp
# - just: command runner
# - jq: JSON processor
# - which: locate a program file in `PATH`
# - python*: required by some Python libraries for compilation during installation
# - libffi*: required for the Python package cffi
# - pipx: Python CLI app installer
# - nodejs: language runtime (includes npm but not Corepack)
# - docker*: used to interact with host Docker socket
# - postgresql*: required to connect to PostgreSQL databases
#
# pipx dependencies:
# - httpie: CLI HTTP client
# - pdm, pipenv: Python package managers
# - pre-commit: Git pre-commit and pre-push hook manager
# - pgcli: PostgreSQL CLI
#
# Node dependencies:
# - n: Node.js distribution manager
# - corepack: Node.js package-manager-manager
