Determine which files have changed in the documentation preview between
the preview branch and the main branch.

This uses the `diff` CLI utility to determine the list of files that have
changed. It then converts the paths to URLs that can be used to view the
files on the docs preview site. Finally, it outputs the preview site docs
generated comment along with a list of new and changed files.
